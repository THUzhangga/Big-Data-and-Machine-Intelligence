In recent years,\\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\\nto the common cold, studies show. \\n\\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \\n\\n\"Friendship is often very painful,\" said Dr. Harriet\\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of \"The Dance of\\nConnection.\" \"In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\\nis bad for my health and I\\'m disbanding it.\" \\n\\nAnother book, \"When Friendship Hurts,\" by Dr. Jan Yager, a\\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\\n\"There\\'s this myth that friendships should last a\\nlifetime,\" Dr. Yager said. \"But sometimes it\\'s better that\\nthey end.\" \\n\\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\\nas more important. \\n\\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\\nbad. \\n\\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\\nLerner said, \"Never once have I had anyone write and say my\\nbest friend hits me.\" \\n\\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \\n\\n\"Now that a marital relationship can\\'t be counted on for\\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\\na way of building community and finding intimacy,\" said Dr.\\nFehr, the author of \"Friendship Processes.\" \\n\\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\\nfocused on its health benefits. \"Now we\\'re starting to look\\nat it as a more full relationship,\" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\\na professor of psychology at Florida International\\nUniversity in Miami. \"Like marriage, friendship also has\\nnegative characteristics.\" \\n\\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \\n\\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\\npursuit. \"When you think of people who were friends at\\nEnron,\" she added, \"you can see how friendship can support\\nantisocial behavior.\" \\n\\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. \"When friends\\nsplit up,\" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, \"it is\\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.\"\\n\\n\\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. \"It\\'s\\nmore than just pulling away,\" she said. \"The silent\\ntreatment is actually malicious.\" \\n\\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend\\'s\\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\\nLerner\\'s patients. \"I would not encourage her to hang in\\nthere and work this one out,\" Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\\nthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\\nresponded to Dr. Yager\\'s most recent survey on friendship\\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\\n\"a derogatory name.\" The woman, now 32, was so devastated\\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\\nbut it is \"more insidious,\" Dr. Yager said. \"Some people\\nconstantly set up their friends,\" she explained. \"They\\'ll\\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\\nshe finds out.\" \\n\\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\\nwho meddles too much in a friend\\'s life, the competitor and\\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \\n\\nMost common is the promise breaker. \"This includes everyone\\nfrom the person who says let\\'s have a cup of coffee but\\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\\nisn\\'t,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\\nto dislike the other one. \\n\\n\"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\\ndiscover there\\'s something important they don\\'t like about\\nthe other person,\" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\\n\"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\\nperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\\nother\\'s dislike criteria.\" \\n\\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\\n\"depends on how large the injury is.\" \\n\\n\"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\\nsomething go,\" she added. \"It\\'s also an act of maturity\\nsometimes to accept another person\\'s limitations.\" \\n\\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\\nfrom each one. \\n\\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\\nget together, ever. \\n\\n\"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\\nbut only one to end it,\" Dr. Yager said. \\n\\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \\n\\n\"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\\nthem in order while you\\'re healthy and your life and work\\nare going well,\" she said. \"Because when a crisis hits,\\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\\nlife-preserving good friendship is.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Plugin1 is simply the default for Safari =\\r\\nfor now (and will likely remain the default forever on Leopard). Chrome =\\r\\nnever bothered to implement a compatibility hack to load Plugin1, and =\\r\\nsimply did without Java support until Apple shipped an NPAPI Plugin2 =\\r\\nthat could render cooperatively via CoreGraphics, and didn\\'t use an =\\r\\noverlay window.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously, Plugin2 is a continuing work in progress that has several =\\r\\nmore technical challenges ahead (like interleaving hardware accelerated =\\r\\ndrawing), will likely require changes to browsers (like adopting =\\r\\nCoreAnimation-NPAPI drawing model), 3rd party libraries (like JOGL), and =\\r\\nwill probably provide a tiered user experience based on which browser =\\r\\nsupports which drawing models, event models, and other features. We are =\\r\\nalso still iterating on the user experience of how to handle applets =\\r\\nthat open their own windows and dialogs that are in a different process =\\r\\nfrom the browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, we don\\'t have any stored setting which tracks the switch =\\r\\nbetween Plugin1 or Plugin2. The state of the Java Preferences UI is =\\r\\nactually just built from the presence or non-presence of the =\\r\\nJavaPluginCocoa.bundle symlink. In a future release when we make Plugin2 =\\r\\nthe default for Safari, we\\'ll simply delete the JavaPluginCocoa.bundle =\\r\\nin /Library/Internet Plug-ins (which we know Mozilla does not use), and =\\r\\nalter Java Preferences to write out a symlink to ~/Library/Internet =\\r\\nPlug-ins instead, so the change is only scoped to the user. At least =\\r\\nthat\\'s the current plan, and it could change, but it\\'s the best idea =\\r\\nwe\\'ve got so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope this provides some perspective on where we\\'d like to go with =\\r\\nPlugin2,\\r\\nMike Swingler\\r\\nJava Runtime Engineer\\r\\nApple Inc.\\r\\n\\r\\n _______________________________________________\\r\\nDo not post admin requests to the list.

It\\'s in dmesg somewhere.  When the\\r\\nfirmware doesn\\'t load you get something like this in dmesg:\\r\\n\\r\\neth1: RTL8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, XID 083000c0\\r\\nIRQ 32\\r\\neth1: unable to apply firmware patch\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk\\r\\nupgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load.\\r\\nHere\\'s what it looks like for Intel 8255X using the e100 driver, with the\\r\\nfirmware blobs all compiled into the kernel:\\r\\n\\r\\ne100 0000:00:0d.0: firmware: using built-in firmware e100/d101m_ucode.bin\\r\\n\\r\\n\"built-in\" signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel\\r\\nat compile time.  I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem.  It\\r\\nonly adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image.  And I use the vanilla\\r\\nkernel.org sources to avoid any Debian \"non-free\" issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob.  There are, IIRC, 3\\r\\nways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel.  This applies to all\\r\\ndevices that require soft firmware, not just NICs:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel\\r\\n2.  Compile the individual blob into the driver, use initrd\\r\\n3.  Put firmware file in root filesystem, tell kernel the path\\r\\n\\r\\n#3 won\\'t work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as\\r\\nblock device drivers.  Those require method 1 or 2.  NICs should be able to\\r\\nuse 1-3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 3 different dmesg statements and 3 different errors depending on\\r\\nwhich method 1-3 above that you\\'re using.\\r\\n\\r\\n>> At least a couple of people on this list went out and bought\\r\\n>> non-RealTek PCI\\r\\n>> NICs to fix the problem instead of reverting to the older kernel.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> I sort of remember that.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, I just pulled the mails.  One upgraded to 2.6.32-trunk on his\\r\\nfirewall, bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an\\r\\nIntel e100 IIRC.  They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the\\r\\nfirmware load failure message referenced up above in this email.  The other\\r\\nhad an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason.  I can\\'t recall how\\r\\nthey fixed that one.  IIRC the OP didn\\'t swap hardware to achieve the fix,\\r\\nso they did something with the kernel/driver/firmware.\\r\\n\\r\\n> I\\'m not surprised.  Since I\\'m only connected to a small 100Mbps LAN\\r\\n> which then connects to a 12Mbps cable modem, it doesn\\'t really affect me.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what\\r\\ntransfers rates you get out of that RTL chip.  I bet you get 1/3rd wire\\r\\nspeed at best, about 30MB/s, if even that.  The machines themselves need to\\r\\nbe modern to saturate the link--no slow CPUs or disks.  Any ~2GHz CPU with\\r\\n512MB RAM and a decent 7.2K RPM SATA disk should be able to push/pull 50MB/s\\r\\nacross the wire.  For that matter, eliminate the disk by creating a 200MB\\r\\nRAM disk on each machine.  Create a test file with dd and FTP/SCP it back\\r\\nand forth between the RAM disks.  If your RTL chip can peak the wire it\\'ll\\r\\nbe a 2-3 second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up\\r\\nto the task.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Maybe if I ever get .32 or .33 I\\'ll squeal in anger.  Until then...\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the\\r\\ntrunk kernel.  You may get lucky.  Then again, if you roll your own and put\\r\\nthe firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do, you shouldn\\'t have a\\r\\nproblem.  That is, if the Debian kernel source doesn\\'t have the blob ripped\\r\\nout for being \"non-free\".\\r\\n\\r\\nYou mentioned you had problems building 2.6.32 and .33 kernel source.  Do\\r\\nyou use the Debian kernel source or kernel.org source?  I\\'ve been using the\\r\\nkernel.org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems\\r\\nwith it (knocks on wood).  I had a build problem with .33 a while back but\\r\\nthat turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine\\r\\nin this warmer weather.  ;)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nStan\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

       "  u'\\r\\nI\\'m looking for a good battery charge/discharge profiler tool for my=20\\r\\nUbuntu laptop. I\\'m aware that there\\'s the \"Power History\" tool, but it=20\\r\\ndoesn\\'t seem to do what I\\'m after. I\\'ll explain....\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of years ago, I came across a really neat tool for Windows for=20\\r\\nestimating the time remaining until the battery is completely charged or =\\r\\n\\r\\ndischarged. It was pretty clever about how it went about it. It would=20\\r\\nconstantly record things like: how much charge the battery said it still =\\r\\n\\r\\nhad, how much the battery said it was charging/discharging at, etc. The=20\\r\\ntool would use this info to estimate the time to charge/discharge...=20\\r\\n/but/ it also went one step further. It could account for errors in the=20\\r\\nbattery\\'s reporting. For example, if the battery reported that it had=20\\r\\n80% charge left, and then, a few minutes later, reported that it had=20\\r\\njust 20% left, then this tool would learn this, and realize that the=20\\r\\nbattery was old/problematic. So, the /next/ time the battery was=20\\r\\nreporting 80% charge left, the tool would know not to give too=20\\r\\noptimistic of an estimate for the remaining time. In other words, the=20\\r\\ntool was learning what \"80%\" /really/ meant to that battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also did something else which was really cool. Because the battery=20\\r\\ndrains at different rates depending upon what you\\'re doing with your=20\\r\\nlaptop (ie, playing a DVD on a bright screen versus just reading some=20\\r\\ntext on a dimmer screen), this tool would actually show you \"best case\"=20\\r\\nand \"worst case\" predictions of your remaining battery life (or time to=20\\r\\ncharge back up) based upon /actual/ discharge rates from /that level/ of =\\r\\n\\r\\nbattery charge remaining that it had experienced on /that/ laptop. So,=20\\r\\nyou\\'d open up the little power-discharge graph tool and you\\'d see three=20\\r\\nlines: a best, a worst, and one in-between which was what rate you\\'re=20\\r\\ncurrently at.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, two questions:\\r\\n1 - Does anyone know what tool that was? (Yes, I know this is a Linux=20\\r\\nforum but, as long as I\\'m describing the tool, I figured I\\'d ask. It\\'s=20\\r\\nnot the PassMark one. I thought it was called BatMon or something, but=20\\r\\nnow I can\\'t find it anywhere).\\r\\n2 - Does anybody know of a tool that does this in Linux? Or, is there=20\\r\\nsome way to get the Gnome power-history tool to show this kind of stuff?\\r\\n\\r\\n- Joe\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

It includes computer calculations that\\nhave produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\\ncrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\\nhelping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\\nthe collapses. \\n\\nAn immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\\ndebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\\naccumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\\ngovernment analysts have been able to put together as they\\nstruggle to answer the scientifically complex and\\nemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\\nfailures of the buildings. \\n\\nBut everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\\nvictims fear that the closely held information, which\\nincludes the analysis and the possible answers that\\nfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, may\\nremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. \\n\\nBound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\\nexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\\nwait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\\ntypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\\nnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\\ncertain material can remain secret for the time being - has\\napproved standard legal arrangements that, should the\\nlawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial\\nmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. \\n\\n\"We\\'re obviously in favor of releasing the information, but\\nwe can\\'t until we\\'re told what to do,\" said Matthys Levy,\\nan engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,\\nwho is a consultant in the case and the author of \"Why\\nBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail\" (Norton, 2nd\\nedition, 2002). \\n\\n\"Let\\'s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole\\nprocess\" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. \\n\\nMonica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the\\nsouth tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper\\nSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.\\n\"If they have answers and are not going to share them, I\\nwould be devastated,\" Mrs. Gabrielle said. \"They have a\\nmoral obligation.\" \\n\\nThe lawsuit that has generated the information involves\\nLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\\ntrade center property, and a consortium of insurance\\ncompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\\nthat hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\\nattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half\\nthat amount, as the insurance companies say. \\n\\nAs both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\\nopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. \\n\\nDean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of\\nHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said\\nof the findings, \"There are some confidentiality agreements\\nthat are keeping those out of the public domain today.\" He\\nconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\\ninsurers on his side of the case could complicate any\\nrelease of the material. \\n\\nAs for his own company, whose consultants alone have\\nproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\\ndiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\\nwould be made to give the material eventually to \"public\\nauthorities and investigative teams.\" \\n\\nStill, some of that analysis relies on information like\\nblueprints and building records from other sources, like\\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\\nand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\\nthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\\ndiffering origins of the material would influence his\\ncompany\\'s ability to release information. \\n\\nIn a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\\nwould be \"decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\\napplicable law and policy,\" adding that it would cooperate\\nwith \"federal investigations.\" \\n\\nThe fate of the research is particularly critical to\\nresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\\ngiven the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\\nthe buildings\\' collapse. That investigation, led by the\\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\\nresources, a lack of access to crucial information like\\nbuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\\nA new federal investigation intended to remedy those\\nfailings has just begun at the National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has\\nstudied many building disasters. \\n\\nOfficials with NIST have said it could take years to make\\nfinal determinations and recommendations for other\\nbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded\\nup with access to the analysis done by the consultants on\\nthe lawsuit. \\n\\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of\\nthe real estate executive\\'s own heavily financed\\ninvestigative work, \"We decline to comment other than to\\nsay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST\\ninvestigation.\" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was\\nin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\\nsaid no transfer had taken place. \\n\\nWith no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\\nboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\\nof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\\ntrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \\n\\n\"The work should be available to other investigators,\" said\\nRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner\\nat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier\\ninquiry. \"It could be used to build better buildings in the\\nfuture.\" \\n\\nLegal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one\\ngoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,\\nfrom full or partial disclosure to destruction of such\\ninformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for the\\nreports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to\\nhave them sealed forever. \\n\"It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep\\nsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,\\nsome legitimate, some not,\" said Lee Levine, a First\\nAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. \\n\\nMr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\\ninformation, the court might look favorably on requests to\\nmake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\\nmaterial is unnerving to many people, especially experts\\nwho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -\\nnot piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\\ntheir own interests - could lead to an advance in the\\nfederal investigation of the trade center. \\n\\n\"It\\'s important for this to get presented and published and\\nsubjected to some scrutiny,\" said Dr. John Osteraas,\\ndirector of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure\\nAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the\\ncase, \"because then the general engineering community can\\nsort it out.\" \\n\\nThe scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\\nany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\\nAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\\nupon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\\nthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\\nthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \\n\\nThe result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\\nthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\\ncore of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\\nproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\\nwhich Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\\npinpoint the structural failures. \\n\\nThe FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\\nmodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\\nthe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\\nimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\\nhampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\\nthe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\\nSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\\nconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he\\nhad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground\\nzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how\\nthe towers fell. \\n\\nThough the FEMA team could not determine \"where things\\nactually fell,\" Mr. Cuoco said, \"we\\'ve indicated the\\nspecific locations.\" \\n\\nMr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details\\nof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details\\nof computer calculations his company has done on the spread\\nof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.\\nOsteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of\\nphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some of\\nwhich he believes have not been available to other\\ninvestigators. \\n\\nAnd the investigation has not limited itself to computers\\nand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind\\ntunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining\\nthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed\\nthe weakening structures. \\n\\nJack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort\\nCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but\\nhad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the\\noriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For\\nthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, \"we\\'ve done probably more\\ndetailed measurements than in the original design.\" \\n\\n\"The data that have been acquired are very valuable in\\nthemselves for understanding how wind and buildings\\ninteract,\" Dr. Cermak said. \"Some of the information may be\\nvaluable for the litigation,\" he said, adding, \"I think\\nI\\'ve told you all I can.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I cannot \\r\\nunderstand that, and \"that\" precisely makes me doubt about the quality of \\r\\nthe format they are trying to populate and rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, even they (they=Adobe)now \"open the specs\" for Flash I will \\r\\navoid either using it or promoting as much as I can.\\r\\n\\r\\n<flashback mode on>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the times I worked as webmaster and web designer (now sysadmin), \\r\\npeople (clients, partners and my company) \"urged\" me to adopt flash \\r\\ntechnology, just because \"looked nice\" and, \"(sic) hey, anyone has the \\r\\nFlash Player installed so it was also kinda cross-platform\". \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Flash Player was (is) available for many systems but the fact is \\r\\nthat that did not change my perception about the suitability of using it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing you couldn\\'t do with standard html technologies \\r\\n(javascript, css, dom...) that Flash can, so why bother about spending \\r\\ntime and money in acquiring a license for Adobe products that were (in \\r\\nthose times) the only powerful ones that allowed the development of \"rich \\r\\nsites\" (\"rich site\" \\u2192 Adobe \"dixit\")?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy bother if there was only a unique Flash player out there and was \\r\\npretty bad quality?

I wasn\\'t trying to imply the same exact code has been\\r\\naround for 17 years.  Hell if that was the case I wouldn\\'t be using it.\\r\\nWhilst the initial Linux porting effort was more than a simple recompile, I\\r\\ndon\\'t believe it was a herculanean effort.  Far more changes to the XFS code\\r\\nhave been made since inclusion in mainline than the changes required to get\\r\\nfrom IRIX to Linux.\\r\\n\\r\\nI actually saw a brief video interview of one of the SGI IRIX devs quite\\r\\nsome time ago in which he described the initial Linux port effort to get it\\r\\nrunning on SGI\\'s big Origin 3000 MIPS machines.  They had to do this to\\r\\nstart validating how everything would run under Linux because they didn\\'t\\r\\nhave the first Itanium Altix systems manufactured yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIIRC their testbed was a 32 processor Origin 3000 running MIPS R14K\\r\\nprocessors.  This was back before the Linux MIPS port project existed so\\r\\nthey were in essence creating the first Linux MIPS port as part of their\\r\\neffort.  He clearly stated that developing/maintaining a Linux MIPS port was\\r\\nnot in the cards for SGI, that this effort was strictly a validation effort.\\r\\n He said it took about a week to get Linux booting on the Origin system, and\\r\\nanother week to get it stable.  The first XFS port to Linux was part of this\\r\\neffort.  If it took only 2 weeks for the bulk of this effort, I can\\'t\\r\\nimagine they had to modify a ton of XFS code.  IRIX was written in C as is\\r\\nLinux, so the changes in XFS were probably fairly minor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d venture to guess that the most significant Linux XFS changes were those\\r\\nfor the 32bit X86 code base.  IRIX and thus XFS were born on 64bit MIPS RISC\\r\\nCPUs.  Moving that to a Linux 64bit Itanium environment was probably\\r\\nrelatively straight forward.  Moving down to a 32bit platform probably\\r\\nrequired a lot of code changes, as did the initial Linux 64bit ports up to\\r\\nAlpha, HPPA, Itanium, and eventually MIPS64.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nStan\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

The festival will be held in Golden Gate\\nPark\\'s Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon\\n- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful\\nDead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of\\nthe late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.\\n\\nArtists participating in this event will permit recording of their\\nperformances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio\\nLicense (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set\\nDuo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,\\nceltic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band\\nAtticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.\\n\\nIn addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including\\nAshley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,\\nFrantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his\\nSideshow Circus.

CAFE empowers the creative community in\\ncyberspace by protecting the public\\'s access to and use of audiovisual\\ntechnologies.\\n\\nThe Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to\\nhelp artists share music more directly with their fans, without\\nsacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages\\ncollaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business\\nmodel strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free\\nsoftware initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages\\nartists to share with one another and their fans\\n\\nAdoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their\\nwork. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks\\nor performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without\\nrelying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music\\ndistribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.\\nThe Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for\\npackaging and distributing music, which is where record companies\\ncurrently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF\\nis committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control\\nover their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.\\n\\nWhen: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm\\n\\nWhere: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the\\nJapanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive\\n\\nMore Information and Travel Directions:\\nhttp://www.eff.org/events/share-in/\\nLinks:\\n\\nEFF\\'s Cafe Project:\\nhttp://www.eff.org/cafe/\\n\\nThe Open Audio License:\\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/Open_licenses/eff_oal.html\\n\\n- end -\\n\\n\\n*Help With Our Internet Blocking in Schools Study\\n\\nIf you know of any public school students, teachers, school\\nadministrators, school board members, parents, or recent public school\\nalumni in the United States who are willing to speak about the impact\\nof Internet blocking on educational opportunities, the EFF would like\\nto make contact with them.

The working \\nclass saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in \\nmutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the \\ninvestment funnel.\\n\\nThe economic system of the first world is designed to strike a \\ndelicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support \\nwealth-expanding through technological innovation or the \\ndevelopment of new markets.  At the 100,000 foot level, recessions \\nand depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the \\nwhirlpool than can be supported by the working class through \\ninvestment and consumption.\\n\\nAnd the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling \\nclass -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al -- \\nand they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the \\nhydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately \\nwasn\\'t sustainable.\\n\\nAnd the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class.

The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by \\nthe time such investments were exposed to the workers.\\n\\nSo, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or \\ninvesting in retirement plans?  I don\\'t think so.  Are they stupid \\nfor buying clothes and automobiles?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nAt the granular level, the notion that \"most rich people are rich \\nbecause they\\'re smart\" is so anecdotal and naive that it\\'s not \\nworth arguing about, so I won\\'t.

Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\\nimportant detail: the program doesn\\'t have to reload when a new page is\\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.\\n\\nAnd because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\\nbrowser.\"\\n\\n===\\n\"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\\n\"home\" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house\\napplications.\"\\n\\n\"Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the\\nInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is\\nmore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth\\nconnections can download portions, or \"stripes,\" of a file from several\\ncached locations simultaneously.

For this exciting installment, CD-R has\\n         concentrated on what it does to people who have to\\n         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short\\n         summary is: if they\\'re not a teacher, a prison warder,\\n         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you\\'re\\n         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the\\n         copy protection says you can\\'t make a backup, you can\\'t.

Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice\\n         in many different directions, but one way in which the two\\n         are similiar is over \"circumvention devices\". Distributing\\n         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the\\n         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous\\n         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are\\n         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in\\n         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for\\n         those who \"distribute otherwise than in the course of a\\n         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the\\n         copyright owner\" one of them. \"Otherwise in the course of\\n         business\" is legalese for \"as an ordinary punter\", so it\\'s\\n         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who\\n         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.\\n         http://www.stand.org.uk/weblog/archive/2002/08/21/000243.php\\n                                   - what you can do to stop all this\\n\\n         That\\'s not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.\\n         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod\\n         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American\\n         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws\\n         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing\\n         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].\\n         In the last week, he\\'s had another letter via Demon, finally\\n         ordering him to remove his shiny \"circumvention device\" (aka\\n         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have\\n         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don\\'t kick in\\n         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what\\n         Andrew\\'s preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK\\n         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There\\'s been some\\n         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,\\n         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the\\n         new rules.

Finally severe regressions should be=20\\r\\nfixed. For packaging, README.Debian needs to be written on how to switch DB=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nbackends since there won\\'t be GUI for it.

       "  u'Hello, all.  With the appreciate help from this list, we finally learned\\r\\nwe needed to install Acrobat Reader version 9.3.2 from unstable into our\\r\\nLenny systems in order for Acrobat to see our CUPS printers.  However we\\r\\nare still having problems printing anything other than letter size jobs.\\r\\nIt looks like acroread is creating an lpr command using the -o\\r\\nPageRegion and setting that option incorrectly.  For example, in one\\r\\ncase we saw -o PageSize=11x17 -p PageRegion=Letter which printed the\\r\\n11x17 print job on letter sized paper.  On a plotter we saw -o\\r\\nPageSize=24x36 -p PageRegion=A4 which resulted in the plotter rejecting\\r\\nthe job as an invalid page size.  Bypassing the Acroread print command\\r\\nby using a Custom printer and sending the job to KPrinter works so this\\r\\nseems to be a clear bug in how Acrobat is reading the PPD file and\\r\\ncreating the print command.\\r\\n\\r\\nHas anyone else encountered this problem?

       "  u\"Gooday,\\n\\nWith warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. \\n\\nIt will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. \\n\\nMy name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.\\n\\nWhen the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !\\n En!\\ngland for 9years now. \\n\\nI am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. \\n\\nTo legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. \\n\\nFor valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.\\n\\nPlease, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. \\n\\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nDonald Phiri. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  u\"Hi All,\\n\\nI have a question which is a bit tricky and was\\nwondering of anyone has come across this problem\\nbefore or could point me in the right direction.\\n\\nI am involved in porting a SCO unix application to\\nLinux, and we have encountered a problem with the way\\nsemaphores  are being handled. The application uses\\nmulitple processes to run application code with the\\nmain process known as the bsh which controls all i/o\\nbe it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled\\nvia semaphores.\\n\\nIn certain circumstances the main process and the\\napplication child process seem to lock up both waiting\\nfor the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I\\nhave attached ddd to the processes and it seems that\\nthe semaphore code is doing the correct things for\\nsyncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the\\nsemop() system call.\\n\\nI have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay\\nbetween changing semaphore states the problem goes\\naway, but this causes our entire application to run\\nreally sloooww !! lol\\n\\nIs there anything weird or different with the standard\\nimplemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could\\ncause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state\\n\\nin a semaphore immediately?\\n\\nSetting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==\\nEAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails\\n(-1) also fixes the problem but again system\\nperformance goes down the toilet.\\n\\nboth the parent controlling process run as the same\\nuid, and the parent creates the semaphores with\\npermissions 0666.\\n\\nAny pointers would be appreciated!\\n\\nRgds,\\n\\nColin Nevin \\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  u'It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids\\' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn\\'t even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou\\'re ahead.  Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\\'s the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\\'t\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It\\'s not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?

This is by virtue of its nature as \\nbeing utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council \\n(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade \\nexhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with \\nyou in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and \\nhope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.\\n\\nWithin the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and \\nprojects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our \\ncontrol as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, \\nwhich we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a \\nforeign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual \\naccount to receive the funds.\\n\\nThe source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria \\nwhich lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded \\nthemselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The \\npresent civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors \\nand as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we \\nhave identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue \\nof our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was \\ntherefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas \\npartner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY \\nONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.\\n\\n the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed \\nso as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government \\nfinancial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation \\nof some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria \\n(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or \\nany other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main \\npartner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of \\naccount information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for \\npayment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, \\nand prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process \\nwould be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.\\n\\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist \\nus in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 \\nmillion (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for \\ntaxation and miscellaneous expenses.\\n\\nThe business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and \\nconfidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful \\nexecution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will \\nnot disappoint me. \\n\\nI will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your \\nknowledge when I have heard from you.\\n\\nThanks for your co-operation,\\n\\nYours faithfully,\\n\\nDr. Kataga Bakori\\n\\nNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 \\n7591666  \\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\\n\\n\\n',\n",

(Which is the\\ngross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't\\nthe most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it\\nwas.

For the record, I don't\\nsupport the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin\\nPowell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).

These folks -do- have a\\nright to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the\\nfolks they elected in the first place.\\n\\nMy point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases\\nsuch as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts\\nwe have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He\\nhas a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the\\nrepresentatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.\\n\\nI think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original\\nthread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming\\ndissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in\\nhaving broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the\\npolicy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the\\nscreaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from\\nthe folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,\\noffensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply\\ndue to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.

       "  u\"\\n       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.\\n       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\\n        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\\n        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\\n        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\\n        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\\n        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\\n        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. \\n        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.\\n         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. \\n         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.\\n         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.\\n          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.\\n          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by List Builder\\nTo unsubscribe follow the link:\\nhttp://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4\\n\",\n",

Hettinga\" <rah@shipwright.com>\\nSubject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation\\nSender: <dbs@philodox.com>\\n\\nhttp://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp\\n\\nPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002\\n\\n\\nDan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation\\n\\nBy Dan Gillmor\\nMercury News Technology Columnist\\n\\nThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy\\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\\n\\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\\nand fiscal mess we\\'ll be cleaning up for decades, we\\'re learning what\\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\\n\\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday\\'s finding by a federal\\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\\nCalifornia\\'s Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\\nalso driving up prices.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider\\'s boast in a\\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\\ncongestion.\\'\\'\\n\\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\\nseen. Unfortunately, California\\'s response -- confusion, lawsuits and\\npolicy tweaks -- hasn\\'t been sufficient.\\n\\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers\\'\\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it\\'s foolish to think\\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\\n\\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That\\'s a\\nreasonable approach, but don\\'t expect miracles.\\n\\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,\\'\\'\\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\\ntempting but a bad idea. When there\\'s genuine competition, as we could\\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\\ninject real competition into the market.\\n\\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\\nis essential.\\n\\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\\nboth.\\n\\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California\\'s utilities\\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\\n\\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\\nideas isn\\'t enough.\\n\\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\\n\\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn\\'t\\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\\nreact to last year\\'s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it\\'s\\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\\naltogether.\\n\\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration\\'s energy policies, so\\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\\n\\nIt\\'s pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world\\'s major economies in its\\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\\nyear.\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR. A.

       "  u'xXxX=\\nxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXThank you for your interest!\\n\\nJudgment Courses offers an extensive training\\ncourse in \"How to Collect MoneyJudgments\"\\n\\nIf you are like many people, you are not even sure what a\\nMoney Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments\\ncan earn you very substantial income .\\n\\nIf you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you\\nwill have a Money Judgment against them.\\n\\nYou are happy you won but you will soon find out the\\nshocking fact: \"Its now up to you to collect on the\\nJudgment\". The court does not require the loser to pay you.\\nThe court will not even help you. You must trace the loser\\ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,\\nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc.\\n\\nVery few people know how to find these assets or what to do\\nwhen they are found. The result is that millions of\\nJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.\\n\\n\"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a\\ndime.\"\\n\\nThe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic\\nproportions. Right now in the United States there is\\nbetween 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney\\nJudgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more\\nJudgments take its place.\\n\\nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have\\nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this\\nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid\\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the\\ntechniques necessary to succeed.\\n\\nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which\\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown\\nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.\\n\\nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with\\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the\\nprocessing of Money Judgments.\\n\\nThe income potential is substantial in this profession. We\\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now\\nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per\\nyear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00\\nand $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of\\ntheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable\\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business\\noffices.\\n\\nToday our company and our associates have over 126\\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently\\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form\\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.\\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break\\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on\\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting\\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police\\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us\\nfor reports.\\n\\n\\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in\\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.\\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or\\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%\\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.\\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to\\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the\\npayment of the principal.\\n\\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per\\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle\\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can\\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are\\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest\\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell\\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.\\n\\n92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%\\nare women and 36% are part time .\\n\\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are\\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off\\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are\\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments\\nare still in force, they do not disappear.\\n\\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your\\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You\\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn\\'t know who you\\nare. You are not a collection agency.\\n\\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing\\nare as follows:\\n\\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals\\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who\\nto write to)\\n\\n8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you\\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don\\'t call them\\nunless you want to.\\n\\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to\\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and\\n50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for\\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.\\n\\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor\\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to\\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three\\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment\\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.\\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to\\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge\\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other\\ncompanies charge $25.00.\\n\\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file\\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.\\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the\\ncourse)\\n\\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to\\nthe original Judgment holder.\\n\\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of\\nJudgment to the court. (Included in the course)\\n\\nQuote\\'s from several of our students:\\n\\nThomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop\\nyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My\\nfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your\\nprofessionalism in both the manual and your support.  \\nYou have the video opened doors for me in the future. \\nThere\\'s no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states \\nhe has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on\"\\n\\nAfter only having this course for four months, Larry S. in\\narea code 314 stated to us: \"I am now making $2,000.00 per\\nweek and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the\\nnext year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in\\njudgments I am collecting on now\"\\n\\nAfter having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated\\n\"I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately\\n$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I\\nwill have to hire someone to help out\"\\n\\nMarshal in area code 407 states to us \"I feel bad, you only\\ncharged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I\\nhave added 3 full time people to help me after only having\\nyour course for 5 months\"\\n\\n>From the above information and actual results you can see\\nwhy we can state the following:\\n\\nWith our course you can own your own successful business.\\nA business which earns you substantial income now and one\\nwhich could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to\\nretire on and travel the world. A business which is\\nextremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every\\nday is new and exciting.\\n\\nNone of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is\\nChallenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate\\nDownsizing. A business which you can start part time from\\nyour home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full\\ntime. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from\\nothers telling you what to do. A business, which lets you\\ncontrol your own destiny. Our training has made this happen\\nfor many others already. Make it happen for you!\\n\\nIf the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you\\nto talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation\\non your part.\\n\\nPlease call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8.\\n\\nWe have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to\\n10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis num=\\nber\\nyou can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.\\nThey can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.\\nSometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations\\nof courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let\\nyou know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you\\nread and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person\\ncan work with you to place your order. We are very low key.

The spammers could still try to have \\nseveral connections at different locations, but that increases their \\ncost and so is not so much interesting.\\n\\n\\tJehan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board\\nfor high-tech professionals.

       "  u\"\\n\\n\\n<i>  My dear Brother,--If I have stayed away from Issoudun, and kept up no intercourse with any one, not even with you, the fault lies not merely with the strange and false ideas my father conceived about me, but with the joys and sorrows of my life in Paris; for if God made me a happy wife, he has also deeply afflicted me as a mother. You are aware that my son, your nephew Philippe, lies under accusation of a capital offence in consequence of his devotion to the Emperor. Therefore you can hardly be surprised if a widow, compelled to take a humble situation in a lottery-office for a living, should come to seek consolation from those among whom she was born. \\nThe Commissary shrugged his shoulders. Arrest them! he exclaimed, much amused. Ah, monsieur, but you are sanguine! No officer of justice has ever succeeded in arresting le Colonel Caoutchouc, as we call him in French. He is as slippery as an eel, that man. He wriggles through our fingers. Suppose even we caught him, what could we prove? I ask you. Nobody who has seen him once can ever swear to him again in his next impersonation. He is impayable, this good Colonel. On the day when I arrest him, I assure you, monsieur, I shall consider myself the smartest police-officer in Europe. \\n\\nMarrier took charge of him.The hail's goin' to drive all through the night, Giant Tom called out in the darkness.   Hazard broke in here in a warmer tone: I know you better than you know yourself! Do you think that I, whose business it is to witness every day of my life the power of my faith, am going to hesitate before a trifle like your common, daily, matter-of-course fears and doubts, such as have risen and been laid in every mind that was worth being called one, ever since minds existed? .Yes, sir. \\nIntent on doing this, she walked along the dusty high road by the river, in the direction of the railway station. This station was more than two miles distant, a long, straight walk by the river, and then a mile or so across fields and by narrow lanes to an arid spot, where some newly-built houses were arising round a hopeless-looking little loop-line station in a desert of agricultural land.  \\n\\nWe left him, scaled the cliff, and turned up a broad, pleasant valley toward the interior.  As it nears Cincinnati the Ohio narrows and deepens, and the banks rise more abruptly. Henry kept close to the southern shore, his body often touching the soft earth. Fortunately the bushes grew thickly, even on the steep cliff, to the water's edge. When he had gone three or four hundred yards he pulled in among them and lay still awhile. He heard the sound of distant shots and he knew that the Indians were still sniping the camp. The curve of the Ohio hid the boats of his friends, and before him the river seemed to be deserted. Yet he was sure that the Indian canoes were on watch. They might be hovering within fifty yards of him.  \\n\\n\\n There were men in this very group who had not heard from home since they left it two years before, and there were letters for men who would never receive them.  The letters were being given out at various points, but where Harry stood a major was calling them in a loud, clear voice.  We led him out to the door. The policeman, in obedience to Charles's orders, held him tight with his hand, but steadily refused, as the prisoner was not violent, to handcuff him. We hailed a passing hansom. To Bow Street! Charles cried, unceremoniously pushing in policeman and prisoner. The driver nodded. We called a four-wheeler ourselves, in which my brother-in-law, Dr. Beddersley and myself took our seats. Follow the hansom! Charles cried out. Don't let him out of your sight. After him, close, to Bow Street!  \\n\\n\\n\\nLasik special starting at $299 - Act Now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA murmur came from the group of Chouans, and it was easy to see that the authority of the new chief was about to be disputed. The young man, on whom this effect of his words was by no means lost, was thinking of the best means of maintaining the dignity of his command, when the trot of a horse was heard in the vicinity. All heads turned in the direction from which the sound came. A lady appeared, sitting astride of a little Breton horse, which she put at a gallop as soon as she saw the young leader, so as to reach the group of Chouans as quickly as possible.  Good! and what risks do you not run by not believing? But let us talk of the worldly aspect of the matter, which most appeals to you. The finger of God is visible in human affairs; see how He directs them by the hand of His vicar on earth. How much men have lost by leaving the path traced out for them by Christianity! So few think of reading Church history, that erroneous notions deliberately sown among the people lead them to condemn the Church; yet the Church has been a pattern of perfect government such as men seek to establish to-day. The principle of election made it for a long while the great political power. Except the Catholic Church, there was no single religious institution which was founded upon liberty and equality. Everything was ordered to this end. The father-superior, the abbot, the bishop, the general of an order, and the pope were then chosen conscientiously for their fitness for the requirements of the Church. They were the expression of its intelligence, of the thinking power of the Church, and blind obedience was therefore their due. I will say nothing of the ways in which society has benefited by that power which has created modern nations and has inspired so many poems, so much music, so many cathedrals, statues, and pictures. I will simply call your attention to the fact that your modern systems of popular election, of two chambers, and of juries all had their origin in provincial and oecumenical councils, and in the episcopate and college of cardinals; but there is this difference,--the views of civilization held by our present-day philosophy seem to me to fade away before the sublime and divine conception of Catholic communion, the type of a universal social communion brought about by the word and the fact that are combined in religious dogma. It would be very difficult for any modern political system, however perfect people may think it, to work once more such miracles as were wrought in those ages when the Church as the stay and support of the human intellect.  It isn't that. But you've never carried baskets, Judge.  Gustave pondered. Yes, there were many lodgings, he informed the lady. And then he thought of Madame Magnotte. Was it not his duty to secure this stray lodger for that worthy woman, if possible? \\n said that Shields was advancing to Manassas Gap with ten thousand men, and from what we heard we know that is true. A second detachment, also ten thousand strong, from McDowell's army is coming toward Front Royal, and McDowell has twenty thousand men east of the Blue Ridge. What the forces to the west are I don't know but the enemy in face of the general himself on the Potomac must now number at least ten thousand. \\n the giddy vortex which keeps so many young people revolving aimlessly, till they go down or are cast upon the shore, wrecks of what they might have been, he gave a shrug and answered briefly: As you please. I'll bring you home as early as you like, and Effie Waring shall take your place in the German. What flowers shall I send you??\\n\\n\\nIt is good, admitted the hunter as he sat Turkish fashion on the leaves, and spread out his hands before the growing flames. The nights grow cold mighty soon here in the high hills of the north, and the heat not only loosens up your muscles, but gives you new courage. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The most powerful \\nof them is l.m. orchard\\'s newest template[1], which provides an insane amount \\nof new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline \\nbased format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a \\nselectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). \\n\\nAlso of interest is Brian Cantoni\\'s FTPStore[2]: _\"FTPstore is a slight \\naddition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve \\nthe personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back \\nto the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep \\nyour saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and \\nat work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in \\nsync.\"_ It\\'s a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.\\n\\n[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml\\n[2] http://www.cantoni.org/software/amphetadesk.html\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I have to kill it\\r\\nand then restart it again to get it to work at all, and then the same\\r\\nthing happens.  I've tried reinstalling it but that hasn't helped.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this behavior ring a bell to anyone?

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \\nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\\n\\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \\nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \\n\\nJay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \\npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \\nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\\nbeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately \\nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \\ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\\n\\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \\ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\\n\\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\\n\\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\\n\\n\\n\\n********************************************************************\\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to\\nother unixen like HPUX and SCO.\\n\\n Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One\\nof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your\\nhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,\\nthey have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software\\nproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.\\n\\n If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There\\nis then a world of different hardware options.

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It\\'s very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they\\'re here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\\' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\\nfact.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

       "  u'URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/07.html#my_good_easy\\nDate: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00\\n\\n_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the \"Good \\nEasy[2]\" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in \\nthis direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say \\nhalf-hearted because I\\'m still application-centric, and I don\\'t go as far with \\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don\\'t use the desktop at all (never have, \\non any system), and I don\\'t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\ncommon programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS \\nhome\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\nbut in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \\n\"$ Explorer work\", \"% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in \\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\nfirst letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \\n\"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other \\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it\\'s probably a sign of a \\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I\\'m done using them \\n(mostly because my laptop doesn\\'t have a lot of memory). \\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\nbash, which I don\\'t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don\\'t let the system position the \\nwindow. \\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search \\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\nthat\\'s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\nin a single directory (d:\\\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin\\'s bash shell \\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for \\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\nI don\\'t use Windows\\' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\nmy D drive I have d:\\\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \\nHOME environment variable), d:\\\\work (contains directories for each work \\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\nall programs that download things), and d:\\\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\ncreated CVS projects). I don\\'t know or care what\\'s where on my C drive. \\n\\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \\naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \\ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\\\home\\\\phone. It is not in \\nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \\nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \\nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \\nmy single most backed-up possession. \\n\\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\\n\\n\\n\\n[1]  http://bitworking.org/Oct2002.html#X631695997519494480\\n[2]  http://www.winterspeak.com/columns/082001.html\\n[3]  http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article02-013\\n[4]  http://www.mozilla.org/\\n[5]  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html\\n[6]  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/\\n[7]  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\\n[8]  http://www.openoffice.org/\\n[9]  http://sillydog.org/narchive/\\n[10] http://gpoulose.home.att.net/\\n[11] http://www.vmware.com/\\n[12] http://www.openoffice.org/\\n[13] http://www.cygwin.com/\\n[14] http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi\\n[15] http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/index.html#notepad\\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\\n[16] http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp\\n[17] http://www.cygwin.com/\\n[18] http://www.guidescope.com/\\n[19] http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10039884.html?part=zonealarm&subj=dlpage\\n\\n\\n',\n",

A proposed law based on the discussion \\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\nearly 2003.\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \\nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \\nCouncil of Europe\\'s cybercrime treaty \\n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \\nprocess of considering.\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \\npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \\nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \\nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \\nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\\n\\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \\nEurope, and representatives from both countries\\' police agencies have \\nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \\ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \\nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \\nor ratified, the treaty.\\n\\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \\nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \\njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \\nweak.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\\'ve given for all the \\nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \\nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\\'s not a particularly convincing \\nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \\nmake that case.\"\\n\\nGeist added that \"there\\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \\npowers) are needed. I don\\'t know that there have been a significant \\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \\norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \\n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \\napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\\n\\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \\nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \\ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \\nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \\nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\\n\\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \\n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \\nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \\nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \\njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \\nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \\n<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> \\nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \\ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\\n\\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \\nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \\npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \\nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \\nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \\nthe draft says.\\n\\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \\nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\\n\\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\\'re allowed to use anonymous \\nmobile phones or whether you\\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \\nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\\n\\nA representative for George Radwanski \\n<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada\\'s privacy commissioner, said \\nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \\nthe paper as it stands.\"\\n\\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \\n<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Your problem is that you are acquiring =\\r\\nan unretained pointer to an object, then doing something that releases =\\r\\nthe object behind your back.\\r\\n\\r\\n    number =3D [metadata objectForKey:key];\\r\\n\\r\\n`number` now points to some object. Importantly, -objectForKey: just =\\r\\nhands back the pointer, without doing the [[result retain] autorelease] =\\r\\ndance. It's possible that the only thing that retained `number` is the =\\r\\n`metadata` dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\n    [metadata setValue:something forKey:key];\\r\\n\\r\\nNow `metadata` has released `number`. It may be dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou need to be careful with -objectForKey: and -objectAtIndex: while you =\\r\\nare mutating the container. Those methods avoid autorelease for =\\r\\nperformance, but (as you found) it's also less safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour solution of copy+autorelease is correct. retain+autorelease might =\\r\\nbe better.=20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--=20\\r\\nGreg Parker     gparker@apple.com     Runtime Wrangler\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n _______________________________________________\\r\\nDo not post admin requests to the list.

Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \\nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\\n3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEO_TS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the \\ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \\n\\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \\ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \\nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven\\'t done anything to decrypt the DVD or \\nviolate the DMCA: I\\'ve used only basic tools available to all normal computer \\nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \\n\\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \\nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \\nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \\nplease let me know.

       "  u\"Hi all,\\nI've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering\\nif anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.\\n\\nI am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.\\nI have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the\\nscsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until\\nprobably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch\\nand installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to\\nburn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed\\ncdburning to work fine.\\n\\nThis problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).\\nthe cdrecord command I was using was\\n    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso\\nThe blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just\\nlocks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,\\nthe system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does\\nreboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages\\n/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).\\ncdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my\\ncdr drive and my cdrw).\\nThe same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.\\n\\nI tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a\\nkernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives\\nthe same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for\\ncdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was\\nwondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used\\nwhich maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much\\ngood, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is\\na)  How to fix the problem ;-)\\nb)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity\\n    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm\\n    not very knowledgeable on these things.\\nc)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If\\n    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond\\n    the guidelines on kernel.org)?\\n\\nLike I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully\\nreceived.\\nmick\\n-- \\nMichael Conry   Ph.:+353-1-7161987, Web: http://www.acronymchile.com\\nKey fingerprint = 5508 B563 6791 5C84 A947  CB01 997B 3598 09DE 502C\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

According\\nto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,\\nshoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.\\nThe figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of\\nanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the\\nUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit\\npeople's shape.\\nThe volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the\\ninner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below\\nthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.\\nIt has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)\\ntaller than his French counterpart.\\nThe mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men\\nonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height\\nadvantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.\\nThe average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared\\nwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and\\n1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and\\nAmericans 1,626.7mm\\nMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other\\nnationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men\\nand 66.7 for women.\\nThe average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7\\ninches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and\\n806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of\\n1,047.2mm.\\nThe average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second\\nlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably\\nsmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.\\nThe average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than\\nthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the\\nSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively\\noutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.\\nHowever Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm\\ncompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,\\ncompared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.\\nThe DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the\\navailable evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm\\nlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American\\naverage.\\nThe British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German\\ncounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.\\nBeverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for\\noccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.\\nThe department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to\\nopen ring pull cans.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

It took two hours to find her.\\n\\nALB> \"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all\\nALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,\" he said. \"I\\nALB> knew then there was something special.\"\\n\\nALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet\\nALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,\\nALB> who is expecting their first child.\\n\\nALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women\\nALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that\\nALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand\\nALB> in search of a wife.\\n\\nALB> \"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I\\'d met Wan,\" he said. \"I knew I\\nALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.\"\\n\\nALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in\\nALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and\\nALB> the couple married.\\n\\nALB> MR. MARRIAGE\\n\\nALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency\\nALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself \"Mr. Marriage,\"\\nALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction\\nALB> agency.\\n\\nALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.\\n\\nALB> \"In the last five years we\\'ve done about 400,\" he said. \"To the best of my\\nALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.\"\\n\\nALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that\\nALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.\\nALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women\\nALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.\\n\\nALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch\\'s\\nALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and\\nALB> language problems.\\n\\nALB> \"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,\"\\nALB> Lynch said. \"But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.\"\\n\\nALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know\\nALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every\\nALB> client has found a potential wife.\\n\\nALB> \"At the end of a fortnight it\\'s very, very rare for a guy to go back and\\nALB> think he hasn\\'t made his mind up,\" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,\\nALB> usually within the next year.\\n\\nALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a\\nALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less\\nALB> than 10 percent have broken up.\\n\\nALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just\\nALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.\\n\\nALB> \"Sometimes they are very nervous,\" she said. \"And sometimes they are very\\nALB> impatient and say \\'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.\\' I say: \\'Calm\\nALB> down, OK, we\\'ll talk.\"\\'\\n\\nALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife\\nALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives\\nALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic\\nALB> stress disorder.\\n\\nALB> WHY?\\n\\nALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics\\nALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to\\nALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of\\nALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.\\n\\nALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is\\nALB> no reason to object. \"If you talk about people who are needy, I think\\nALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I\\nALB> need Wan,\" he said.\\n\\nALB> \"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there\\'s no\\nALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don\\'t have a problem\\nALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to\\nALB> their future husband.\"\\n\\nALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they\\nALB> choose to use his agency.\\n\\nALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the \"kind of de-feminized,\\nALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British\\nALB> singles scene,\" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are\\nALB> not \"God\\'s gift to women.\"\\n\\nALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their\\nALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.\\n\\nALB> \"They don\\'t know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques\\nALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?\\nALB> Impossible,\" she said.\\n\\nALB> \"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are\\nALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from\\nALB> ladies from other countries.\"\\n\\nALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,\\nALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also\\nALB> not a major obstacle.\\n\\nALB> \"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having\\nALB> a husband who is significantly older,\" Lynch said. \"When I met my wife she\\nALB> couldn\\'t speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic\\nALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up\\nALB> very quickly.\"\\n\\nALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move\\nALB> to the West.\\n\\nALB> \"We have kitchens, we have study classes,\" Roongthip said. \"We teach them\\nALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.\"\\n\\nALB> PITFALLS\\n\\nALB> But not all dreams come true. \"Bee\" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to\\nALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is\\nALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.\\n\\nALB> \"He had no friends, and I was so lonely,\" she said. \"I tried to make him\\nALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never\\nALB> spoke to me.\"\\n\\nALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. \"I thought I would be happy\\nALB> there,\" she said. \"But it was the worst time of my life.\"\\n\\nALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure\\nALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.\\n\\nALB> \"We are ethical and professional,\" he said. \"We will not take on all\\nALB> comers.\"\\n\\nALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the\\nALB> arrangement can work. Wan\\'s sister has just signed up with Lynch\\'s company,\\nALB> looking for a foreign husband.\\n\\nALB> \"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I\\'m sure there are,\"\\nALB> Moylan said. \"But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nBest regards,\\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Sonnets.\\n\\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,\\ndramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English\\nwriter of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in\\nStratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him\\nuntil he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed\\nquick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a\\nmember of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the\\nKing's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful\\ncareer as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants\\nalike.\\n\\nShakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the\\nwriter's life, leading many over the years to attempt to\\nfill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that\\nonly result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will\\nprobably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses\\noffered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;\\nilliterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet\\n(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to\\ntake credit to shield the real writer -- a person with\\npolitical ties).\\n\\nShakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind\\nand heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154\\nsonnets involve the author's relationship with various\\ncharacters, including a striking young man, a mysterious\\nwoman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters\\nhave also been the subject of much speculation over the\\nyears, despite the fact that they may have been completely\\ncreated in the mind of the bard.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBy Mickie Kennedy of http://www.poetrypreviews.com\\nCopyright DayTips.com, Inc., 2002.

       "  u'It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids\\' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn\\'t even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou\\'re ahead.  Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\\'s the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\\'t\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It\\'s not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren\\'t laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you\\'re looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain\\'t\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.

Lynch, who calls himself \"Mr. Marriage,\"\\nstarted the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction\\nagency.\\n\\nSince then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.\\n\\n\"In the last five years we\\'ve done about 400,\" he said. \"To the best of my\\nknowledge, they have all been successful.\"\\n\\nMale clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that\\nrequire them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.\\nClients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women\\nlooking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.\\n\\nClients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch\\'s\\noffice -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and\\nlanguage problems.\\n\\n\"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,\"\\nLynch said. \"But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.\"\\n\\nAfter the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know\\neach other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every\\nclient has found a potential wife.\\n\\n\"At the end of a fortnight it\\'s very, very rare for a guy to go back and\\nthink he hasn\\'t made his mind up,\" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,\\nusually within the next year.\\n\\nRoongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a\\nBangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less\\nthan 10 percent have broken up.\\n\\nRoongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just\\narrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.\\n\\n\"Sometimes they are very nervous,\" she said. \"And sometimes they are very\\nimpatient and say \\'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.\\' I say: \\'Calm\\ndown, OK, we\\'ll talk.\"\\'\\n\\nBut if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife\\nand get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives\\nfor include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic\\nstress disorder.\\n\\nWHY?\\n\\nSimilar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics\\nsay they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to\\nform relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of\\nimpoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.\\n\\nBut Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is\\nno reason to object. \"If you talk about people who are needy, I think\\neverybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I\\nneed Wan,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there\\'s no\\nsecret there. They are looking for a better life. I don\\'t have a problem\\nwith that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to\\ntheir future husband.\"\\n\\nLynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they\\nchoose to use his agency.\\n\\nHis brochure promises an alternative to the \"kind of de-feminized,\\nover-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British\\nsingles scene,\" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are\\nnot \"God\\'s gift to women.\"\\n\\nRoongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their\\nown countries -- and found Thai women attractive.\\n\\n\"They don\\'t know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques\\nor restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?\\nImpossible,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are\\ngood at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from\\nladies from other countries.\"\\n\\nAlthough many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,\\nthe agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also\\nnot a major obstacle.\\n\\n\"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having\\na husband who is significantly older,\" Lynch said. \"When I met my wife she\\ncouldn\\'t speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic\\ndictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up\\nvery quickly.\"\\n\\nMany agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move\\nto the West.\\n\\n\"We have kitchens, we have study classes,\" Roongthip said. \"We teach them\\nhow to eat, and when to make tea.\"\\n\\nPITFALLS\\n\\nBut not all dreams come true. \"Bee\" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to\\nSwitzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is\\nback in Bangkok, sad and angry.\\n\\n\"He had no friends, and I was so lonely,\" she said. \"I tried to make him\\nhappy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never\\nspoke to me.\"\\n\\nBee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. \"I thought I would be happy\\nthere,\" she said. \"But it was the worst time of my life.\"\\n\\nLynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure\\nunsuitable candidates are weeded out.\\n\\n\"We are ethical and professional,\" he said. \"We will not take on all\\ncomers.\"\\n\\nMoylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the\\narrangement can work. Wan\\'s sister has just signed up with Lynch\\'s company,\\nlooking for a foreign husband.\\n\\n\"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I\\'m sure there are,\"\\nMoylan said. \"But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Ooops, no wait, scratch that.\\n\\nThere is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be\\nprecisely \"free trade/markets\" -- when Ben Franklin first visited\\nEngland he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.

The\\nBritish bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to\\nclamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were\\nrife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.\\n\\nAccording to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political\\nparty here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about\\ntea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were\\nprotesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces\\nthat killed Ned Ludd\\'s followers as to why popular opinion believes\\nthey were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada\\nwas also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the\\nlate-50\\'s or early 60\\'s, the right to print money was removed from the\\njuristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.\\n\\nI\\'ve wondered about all this.

I\\'m not a C programmer,\\nbut I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are\\ninstructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile\\nprocess, and include all sorts of symbols/functions\\ne.g. \"#include <math.h>\" gives you maths type functions.  Since they\\nstart with \"#\" they are ignored in the final compilation.\\n\\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \\nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\\n    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4\\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to\\npersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this\\nis the right way to proceed.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the steps above regarding \"make dep\" and so forth\\nshould have been performed in the directory where the make process is\\nlooking for modversions.h & Co.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as\\nyou describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you\\nhave done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after\\nthat, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)\\nfiles.

       "  u'Well, I\\'ve used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in\\nmany places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it\\nis effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint\\nstate, then aren\\'t we modifying the sequences file for the current\\nfolder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file\\nmore than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can\\nstick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.\\n\\nSomeone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.\\nWe could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -\\nTcl has had \"clock seconds\" (like gettimeofday) and \"clock clicks\"\\n(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we\\'ve calibrated\\nclock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for\\nrelative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond\\ndelta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all\\nthe overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I\\'ll try it out.\\n\\n>>>Chris Garrigues said:\\n > > From:  Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com>\\n > > Date:  Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700\\n > >\\n > > \\n > > >>>Robert Elz said:\\n > >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\\n > >  > context file) but I\\'m not sure how frequently that one is called.\\n > > \\n > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify\\n > time,\\n > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to\\n > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again.\\n > \\n > Do you really think this is true?

The clues below are *loaded* with snippets unique to HTML (like \\'<br>\\').\\n\\nI *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01\\nclues.  But that\\'s wrong too!

At first I thought that the red VGA signal had a bad contact,\\r\\nbut X came up in full color. Console apps can control the color to a\\r\\ncertain extent, but the default color is a really gross cyan which\\r\\nproduces weird color effects on an LCD with the thni Terminus fonts.\\r\\nIn other words, I can\\'t live with it.

And, I think that:\\n\\nLooks like a case of \"MY experience is comprehensive, YOUR\\'S is\\nanecdotal, THEY don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about\".\\n\\n\\n>1.  The people who pay the wages don\\'t give a flyin\\' heck what programming\\n>language you write things in... they just want it to work.\\n\\nIn my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in\\nparticular it has to work with what they\\'ve already got, and it has to\\nwork on client\\'s systems.\\n\\nMy limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on\\nLinux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven\\'t come back yet.\\n\\nMicrosoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.\\nThey took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a\\nservice pack.  Somehow, I can\\'t imagine them removing the ability to\\nrun C programs.\\n\\n\\n>2.  C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory\\n>management over and over again.\\n\\nCan\\'t say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management\\nissues, apart from the fact that I frequently need > 4 GB.\\n\\n\\n>It\\'s about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...\\n\\nIf your problem just requires application of a \"design pattern\" to solve,\\nthen it\\'s trivial anyway irrespective of language.\\n\\n\\n>I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low\\n>level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over\\n>and over again...\\n\\nYou appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time\\non irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don\\'t.  Depends\\nentirely on the programmer, not the language.\\n\\n\\n>3.  Java is not just a programming language! It\\'s also a platform...\\n\\nBuzzword.\\n\\n\\n>a monolithic set of API\\'s or a crap load of different API\\'s slicing\\n>and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?\\n\\nUnsupported assertion.\\n\\n\\n>4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you\\n>can\\'t possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within\\n>the same magnitude of cost as Java....\\n\\nDunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC\\nin a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be\\n10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable\\nlibraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.\\nAt least that is the case when then language you used is available on\\nthe target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.\\n\\n\\n>5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a\\n>person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the\\n>individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is\\n>to reverse engineer C (large applications).\\n\\nYou can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get\\nsome kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for\\nmaintenance headaches ad infinitum.\\n\\n \\n>6.  Hardware is getting so fast that I\\'m not sure if the performance\\n>difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.\\n\\nWhoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I\\'m taking\\ntime out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could\\nwait 5 years until everyone\\'s PC is fast enough to generate random EC\\'s\\nin no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code\\nthat is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,\\nor I can do it now when very few people can.\\n\\n \\n>The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n\\n>And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others\\n>allow you to think more high level than low level.  Thinking of bits\\n>and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important\\n>problems....\\n\\nIt\\'s true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes\\nme spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!\\nNot.\\n\\nActually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.\\n\\n\\n>Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems\\n>over and over again [...]\\n\\nDunno, and frankly I don\\'t see the relevance to the issue at hand.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.

       "  u\"Hi all,\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm trying to get Java1.6 working on my MacBook Pro 1,1 which has  \\r\\n10.5.8 on it. I've downloaded a package from the OpenJDK project, and  \\r\\nI've got it setup using the directions\\r\\nthat I've found at the bottom of this thread:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.mailarky.com/thread.php?page=1&id=197627\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere I've setup an OpenJDK6.jar folder in my ~/Library/Java/ \\r\\nJavaVirtualMachines directory. I've got the proper directory  \\r\\nstructure, but no luck in having it recognized by the\\r\\n/usr/libexec/java_home function.

STEPS 1-6\\n=======================\\n\\n1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports from your CBN money list, take\\nthis original saved email and REMOVE the name & address of the person in\\nREPORT # 5.

BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR NAME\\nIN THE #1 POSITION AND THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS\\nDOCUMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BUSINESS AND\\nSUBSEQUENTLY THE SIZE OF YOUR PROFITS.****\\n\\nAs soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM!\\nThese are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do\\nthese reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,\\nyou will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.\\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5\\nreports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to\\nsend bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified\\nads and much more.\\n\\nThere are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going:\\n\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,\\nand we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails\\neach. Let\\'s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%\\n(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just\\nsay it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of\\nthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this\\nexample, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\\n\\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10\\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That\\'s=100\\npeople responded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail\\nsent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000\\n(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million\\ndollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....\\n$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nREMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\\n5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if\\neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\\neach or more?\\n\\nTHE NUMBERS DON\\'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT\\nhttp://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to\\nplug in your own numbers and see the results.\\n\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds\\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\\nwill easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly\\nsuggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to\\nbecome more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.\\nRemember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure\\nproper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.\\n\\n\\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\\n\\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2\\nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.\\n\\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you\\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,\\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\\n\\n**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN\\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash\\nwill continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a\\ndifferent report.\\n\\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\\nordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER\\nBATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\\n=================================================\\n\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:\\n\\nCash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole\\nproprietors.  However, this program will only work if you are willing\\nto put in the time and effort to make it work.  This is not a program\\nfor everybody.

I realize that there is an issue of polluting the\\ncatalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue\\nserver? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here?

Note the very careful wording, so\\nexhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day\\nwith some cheese.\\n\\nInteresting timing, since 16,000 truckers just lost their jobs and dont have\\nto worry about death from this anymore.\\n\\n- Adam L. \"Duncan\" Beberg\\n  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/\\n  beberg@mithral.com\\n\\n--------\\n\\nEPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer\\nWed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET\\nBy H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\\nsources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\\nAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\\n\\nThe EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government\\'s\\npush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\\nand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\\nexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\\nanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\\nrisk to humans.\\n\\n\"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\\nexposure levels\" as well, the report said. \"The potential human health\\neffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\\nuncertainties are involved.\"\\n\\nThe report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\\nworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\\nsignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\\nemissions under the Clean Air Act.\\n\\nSome environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\\nadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\\nwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\\nseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\\n\\nEPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\\nthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\\nthe EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\\nthe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\\nmeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\\n\\nThe engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\\nalthough the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\\nis expected to produce pollution reductions.\\n\\nThe EPA\\'s 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\\nprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\\ndiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\\ngauging pollution health concerns.\\n\\nBut in this case, the report said, \"the exposure-response data are\\nconsidered too uncertain\" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\\ncancer risk to an individual.\\n\\nNevertheless, said the report, the \"totality of evidence from human, animal\\nand other supporting studies\" suggests that diesel exhaust \"is likely to be\\ncarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\\nenvironmental exposure.\"\\n\\nThe report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\\nshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\\n\"chronic respiratory hazard to humans\" contributing to increased asthma and\\nother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\\nas much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\\nto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\\ndiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\\nexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\\nsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\\n\\nEmily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\\nenvironmental organization, said: \"To reduce the public\\'s exposure to\\nharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\\nclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\\nstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment.\"\\n\\nAllen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\\nForum, said the EPA\\'s report \"focused on the past,\" whereas \"the future is\\nclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times\\ncleaner than just a dozen years ago.\"\\n\\nThe report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in\\nthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow\\nturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  u'OK, let\\'s bring some data into the discussion:\\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm\\n(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature\\nfluctuations over the past 400k years).\\n\\n> Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\\n> temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\\n> correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\\n> are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\\n> increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\\n> preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\\n> of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\\n> correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\\n> causative.\\n\\nBased on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation\\nbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn\\'t always appear to\\nbe causal.\\n\\n> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\\n> point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\\n> regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.\\n\\nAlso correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.\\n\\n> As it\\n> happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\\n> cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.\\n\\nNot correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and\\n<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2\\nconcentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded\\nvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing\\nat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the\\nVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn\\'t capable of such fine\\nresolution).\\n\\n> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,\\n\\nNo, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:\\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm\\n(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the \"historical record\").\\n\\nNot only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok\\nrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.\\nThere is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for\\nanthropogenic input. You\\'re really out on the fringe if you\\'re debating\\nthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.\\n\\n> but it looks a lot like we\\n> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\\n> record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\\n> concentrations.\\n\\nWrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past\\n400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly\\nspike, and then return back to \"normal\" background levels (and hence the\\nspike might not show up in the ice cores).\\n\\nStill, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that\\neven you would have a hard time arguing away.\\n\\n> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\\n> affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\\n> predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\\n> feedback systems mentioned above.\\n\\nYes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a\\nfinite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn\\'t increase,\\nbut we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be\\nenormous.\\n\\n> Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn\\'t particularly potent, although it\\n> makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\\n> methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\\n> basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\\n> that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\\n> biosphere.\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nData on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:\\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm\\n\\nNote that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial\\nlevels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also\\na contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly\\nanthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I\\'m in favor of reductions in\\nmethane levels as well.\\n\\nData on water vapor here:\\nhttp://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html\\n\\n> CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\\n> studies and data I\\'ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\\n> passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.\\n\\nI tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in\\nreducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,\\nwind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources\\nof C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense\\n(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve\\nreductions in lifestyle to a \"sustainable\" level are unrealistic --\\nAmericans just won\\'t do it (you\\'d be surprised at the number of climate\\nchange researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last\\nyear\\'s energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and\\nimproved efficiency is an easy sell.\\n\\n- Jim\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Contact addresses.\\n\\n\\n1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHistorically, families have usually had more children than parents,\\nresulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in\\nrecent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the\\nnumber of children per generation has steadily gone down, while\\nlife span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree\\nthat some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,\\nwith few people in each generation. The term \"beanpole family\" has\\nbeen around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it\\nrarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to\\nwider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it\\ntoo slangy and prefer the jargon term \"verticalised\" to describe\\nsuch families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that\\nthe demographic shift is having a big effect on personal\\nrelationships within the family and (for example) the role of\\ngrandparents.\\n\\nThe rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the\\n\\'beanpole\\' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in\\ndivorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single\\nchild.\\n                                             [\"Observer\", May 2002]\\n\\nNoting the rising number of so-called \\'beanpole\\' families in\\nBritain (families with only one child), the report warns that a\\nchild without siblings \\'is starved of the companionship of family\\nmembers of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,\\nwith teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life\\'.\\n                                            [\"Guardian\", June 2002]\\n\\n\\n2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nA stupid person, a blockhead.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped\\nout of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it\\nthat I can find is in the classic W C Fields film \"The Bank Dick\"\\nof 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:\\n\"Surely, don\\'t be a luddie-duddie, don\\'t be a moon-calf, don\\'t be a\\njabbernow, you\\'re not those, are you?\". Before that, it turns up in\\none of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems\\nto have been rather rare.\\n\\nIt\\'s from the old French \"jobard\", from \"jobe\", silly. That word\\nwas then added to \"noll\", the top or crown of the head, the noddle.\\nThe first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was\\nsoon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.\\n\"Jobbernowlism\" is the condition or state of being a \"jobbernowl\",\\nor an act or remark that is especially stupid.\\n\\nCareful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!\\n\\n\\n3. Beyond Words\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI\\'ve been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past\\nfew days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign\\nposted above some steps at the local railway station:\\n\\n   Caution\\n   Do not run on the stairs\\n   Use the hand rail\\n\\n\\n4. Q&A\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nQ. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer\\nelectronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come\\nacross the expression \"bells and whistles\", which seem to relate to\\nequipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer\\nas plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.\\nIs that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve\\nCastelain, France]\\n\\nQ. You\\'re right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to\\ngimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a\\npiece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem\\nmore superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.\\n\\nThe phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the\\nAmerican military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in\\nan article in \"Atlantic\" in October 1982, which said it was\\n\"Pentagon slang for extravagant frills\". There\\'s some evidence that\\nthe term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early\\nevidence is sparse.\\n\\nWhere it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal\\nsense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth\\ncentury, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before\\nmodern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud\\nwarning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam\\nmade the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the\\nnoisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans\\nwill agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at\\none time \"clang, clang, clang went the trolley\" in large numbers of\\nAmerican cities.\\n\\nAt least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and\\nwhistles, as this extract from an article in \"Appleton\\'s Journal\"\\nof 1876 shows:\\n\\n  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping\\n  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky\\n  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by\\n  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and\\n  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little\\n  children, so diminished are they by the distance.\\n\\nCould it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought\\nexcessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a\\nfrill?\\n\\nPossibly. But it\\'s more probable the slang sense of the term comes\\nfrom that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre\\norgan. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer\\naugmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to\\nhelp the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,\\nsirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and\\norgans often had \"toy counters\" with 20 or more noisemakers on\\nthem, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades\\nafter the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still\\ncommon in big movie houses, these fun features must have been\\nconsidered no longer essential to the function of the organ but\\nmere fripperies, inessential add-ons.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up\\nespecially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities\\nto add them are so great.\\n\\n                        -----------\\n\\nQ. The designation of \"robes\" for academic dress clearly comes from\\nits origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about\\n\"mortarboards\"? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or\\n13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does\\n\"mortarboard\" refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?\\n\\nA. The academic cap often called a \"mortarboard\" is quite ancient,\\nbut that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth\\ncentury (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a\\n\"square\"). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually\\nwith a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts\\nof mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually\\ncall it a hawk.\\n\\nWhat seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between\\nthe brickie\\'s board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at\\nOxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our\\nfirst recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, \"The Adventures of Mr.\\nVerdant Green, an Oxford Freshman\" by a clergyman named Edward\\nBradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names\\nof the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).\\nVerdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book\\nrecounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don\\nappears after one such escapade: \"I will overlook your offence in\\nassuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave\\nthe offensive epithet of \\'mortar-board\\'; more especially, as you\\nacted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have\\nknown better\".\\n\\nAfter a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more\\nthan 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley\\ninvented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly\\npopularised it.\\n\\n                        -----------\\n\\nQ. I got into a discussion about \"chip off the old block\" with\\nfriends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,\\njewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this\\nterm mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]\\n\\nA. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely\\nmade of wood.\\n\\nThe first form of the expression was \"chip of the same block\",\\nmeaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as\\nsomebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.\\nAn early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time\\nBishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: \"Am not I a child of the same Adam\\n... a chip of the same block, with him?\".\\n\\nLater that century, another form is recorded \"a chip of the old\\nblock\", which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his\\nfather, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,\\nprobably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to \"a\\nchip off the old block\", which does nothing to change the sense,\\nbut is the way it\\'s now usually written or said.\\n\\n\\n5.

(It is\\namazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for\\nUPS\\'s to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and\\nits battery supply...)\\n\\nFirst, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was\\noccurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a\\nsequence that isn\\'t either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of\\nsuch things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.\\nThis one solves the initial problem:\\n\\n--- mh.tcl.WAS\\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002\\n+++ mh.tcl\\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002\\n@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@\\n     set seq {}\\n     set rseq {}\\n     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {\\n+\\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {\\n+\\t    # just ignore anything bogus\\n+\\t    continue;\\n+\\t}\\n \\tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]\\n \\tif {[llength $parts] == 1} {\\n \\t    lappend seq $parts\\n\\n\\nThat is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring\\nbefore (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should\\nprobably make sure that\\'s true - issue an error instead of just \"continue\"\\nif you like, but I don\\'t think an error is needed).\\n\\nBut that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,\\nby typing \"NNN-\" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,\\nI thought I should think more about Brent\\'s suggestion.   But rather than\\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\\na \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\\nuser has typed.\\n\\nThis way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\\nallowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can\\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.\\n\\nBut, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\\nIf you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that\\nis typed).   I suspect that\\'s perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a\\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it,\\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.\\n\\nAnd then I wondered about folders with names containing \\'+\\' - the special\\nuse of + as the toggle character means there\\'s no way to type those from\\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\\nrestrictions - there\\'s no way to type a folder name that has a name\\nbeginning with \\'+\\' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\\ntoggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name\\nbeing typed is empty.   I\\'m less happy about that part, but I think I\\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +\\'s in them to\\nexist and be typed.\\n\\nThen, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, \\'s\\' is\\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you\\'ve just typed 123, and\\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\\nshow that message, you can\\'t type \\'s\\', you have to type \\\\r instead.\\nSo I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes\\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is \\'s\\', if you change that to something\\nelse, it will remain \\'s\\' in here.   I don\\'t know enough tk/tcl to have it\\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\\nto bind the same one here.   \\\\r continues to work of course.\\n\\nAnd now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\\nreverted to its usual bindings.\\n\\nIn any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\\n\"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don\\'t think we really\\nneed to fix Brent\\'s way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\\nfor completeness (I haven\\'t run an exmh with the following patch, but not\\nthe previous one, so I don\\'t know for sure that all will be OK then).\\n\\nkre\\n\\n--- select.tcl.WAS\\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\\n+++ select.tcl\\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\\n     bind $w <Any-Key>\\t{SelectTypein %W %A}\\n     bind $w <Key-plus>\\t{SelectToggle %W }\\n+    bind $w <Key-minus>\\t{SelectPrev %W }\\n     bind $w <space>\\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w <Tab>\\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w <Return>\\t{SelectReturn %W}\\n+    bind $w <Key-s>\\t{SelectReturn %W %A}\\n     bind $w <BackSpace>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w <Control-h>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w <Delete>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\\n     append select(sel) $a\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\\n-\\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\\n     }\\n }\\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w +\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\\n \\tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"\\n     } else {\\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\\n     }\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n }\\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\\n+    global select\\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tSelectTypein $w \"-\"\\n+    } else {\\n+\\tcatch {\\n+\\t    incr select(sel) -1\\n+\\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\t}\\n+        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n+    }\\n+}\\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\\n \\tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     }\\n }\\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$a != {}} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w $a\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tif [info exists select(match)] {\\n \\t    set select(sel) $select(match)\\n \\t    unset select(match)\\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\\n \\tunset select(folder)\\n     }\\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\\n+    Exmh_Status \"\"\\n     Exmh_Focus\\n }\\n proc SelectClear { w } {\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-workers mailing list\\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\\n\\n',\n",

       "  u'\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\nCERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP\\n\\n   Original release date: July 22, 2002\\n   Last revised: --\\n   Source: CERT/CC\\n\\n   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.\\n\\nSystems Affected\\n\\n     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1\\n\\nOverview\\n\\n   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could\\n   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP\\n   and/or the web server.\\n\\nI. Description\\n\\n   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more\\n   information about PHP, see\\n\\n          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php\\n\\n   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for\\n   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a\\n   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can\\n   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an\\n   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be\\n   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or\\n   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to\\n   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the\\n   privileges of the web server.\\n\\n   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some\\n   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the\\n   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own\\n   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is\\n   irrelevant to this problem.\\n\\n   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot\\n   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system\\n   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard\\n   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques\\n   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.\\n\\n   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described\\n   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an\\n   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status\\n   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.\\n\\n   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,\\n   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older\\n   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we\\n   encourage you to review\\n   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html\\n\\nII. Impact\\n\\n   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.\\n   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due\\n   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage\\n   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an\\n   x86 architecture.\\n\\nIII. Solution\\n\\nApply a patch from your vendor\\n\\n   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.\\n   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this\\n   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular\\n   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.\\n   Please contact your vendor directly.\\n\\nUpgrade to the latest version of PHP\\n\\n   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version\\n   4.2.2.\\n\\nDeny POST requests\\n\\n   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST\\n   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security\\n   Advisory:\\n\\n     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on\\n     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST\\n     requests on the web server.\\n\\n     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the\\n     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a\\n     top-level .htaccess file:\\n\\n     <Limit POST>\\n        Order deny,allow\\n        Deny from all\\n     </Limit>\\n\\n     Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have\\n     parameters contradicting the example given above.\\n\\nDisable vulnerable service\\n\\n   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.\\n   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that\\n   are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully\\n   consider your service requirements.\\n\\nAppendix A. - Vendor Information\\n\\n   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this\\n   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will\\n   update this section and note the changes in our revision history.

       "  u'This article from NYTimes.com \\nhas been sent to you by luke@applix.com.\\n\\n\\nThe mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all, much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures, much less present it to the public, and that the Bush administration appears to be against American-style justice.\\n\\nThe default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing.  The administration is here making the case that Americans don\\'t even have a right to question government secrecy.\\n\\nWe may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public, made possible by the urgency of reacting to 9/11.\\n\\n\\nluke@applix.com\\n\\n\\nAfter Sept. 11, a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty\\n\\nAugust 4, 2002\\nBy THE NEW YORK TIMES \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis article was reported and written by Adam Liptak, Neil\\nA. Lewis and Benjamin Weiser. \\n\\nIn the fearful aftermath of Sept. 11, Attorney General John\\nAshcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal\\ngovernment and \"every available statute\" to hunt down and\\npunish \"the terrorists among us.\" \\n\\nThe roundup that followed the attacks, conducted with\\nwartime urgency and uncommon secrecy, led to the detentions\\nof more than 1,200 people suspected of violating\\nimmigration laws, being material witnesses to terrorism or\\nfighting for the enemy. \\n\\nThe government\\'s effort has produced few if any law\\nenforcement coups. Most of the detainees have since been\\nreleased or deported, with fewer than 200 still being held.\\n\\n\\nBut it has provoked a sprawling legal battle, now being\\nwaged in federal courthouses around the country, that\\nexperts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance\\nbetween individual liberties and national security. \\n\\nThe main combatants are the attorney general and federal\\nprosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders,\\nimmigration and criminal defense lawyers, civil\\nlibertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other,\\nwith federal judges in between. \\n\\nThe government\\'s record has so far been decidedly mixed. As\\nit has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits,\\nthe courts, particularly at the trial level, have pushed\\nback, stopping well short of endorsing Mr. Ashcroft\\'s\\ntactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them.\\nFederal judges have, however, allowed the government to\\nhold two American citizens without charges in military\\nbrigs, indefinitely, incommunicado and without a road map\\nfor how they might even challenge their detentions. \\n\\nIn the nation\\'s history, the greatest battles over the\\nreach of government power have occurred against the\\nbackdrop of wartime. Some scholars say the current\\nrestrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by\\nhistorical standards and in light of the risks the nation\\nfaces. \\n\\nThe current struggle centers on three sets of issues.\\nPeople held simply for immigration violations have objected\\nto new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret,\\nand they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on\\nwhat they call unconstitutional preventive detentions. \\n\\nPeople brought in and jailed as material witnesses, those\\nthought to have information about terrorist plots, have\\nargued that they should not be held to give testimony in\\ngrand jury investigations. \\n\\nFinally, Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two\\nAmericans labeled \"enemy combatants\" for what the\\ngovernment contends is more direct involvement with\\nterrorist groups, are seeking rights once thought to be\\nfundamental to American citizens, like a lawyer\\'s\\nrepresentation and a chance to challenge their detentions\\nbefore a civilian judge. \\n\\nSo far, federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered\\nsecret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny,\\nand on Friday a federal district judge in Washington\\nordered that the identities of most of the detainees be\\nmade public under the Freedom of Information Act. \\n\\n\"Secret arrests,\" Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the\\ndecision on Friday, \"are a concept odious to a democratic\\nsociety.\" \\n\\nA senior Justice Department official said the detentions\\nhad been lawful and effective. He said it was hard to\\n\"prove a negative\" and cite specific terrorist acts that\\nhad been disrupted. But he said that department officials\\nbelieved that the detentions had \"incapacitated and\\ndisrupted some ongoing terrorist plans.\" \\n\\nTwo federal judges in New York have differed sharply on\\nwhether the government may jail material witnesses while\\nthey wait to testify in grand jury investigations. In\\nVirginia, a federal judge ordered the government to allow\\nMr. Hamdi to consult a lawyer. \\n\\n\"I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer\\nthem on, because they are doing exactly what an independent\\njudiciary should be doing,\" said Jane E. Kirtley, a\\nprofessor at the University of Minnesota and former\\nexecutive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom\\nof the Press. \"It\\'s not hostile or adversarial; it\\'s simply\\nskeptical.\" \\n\\nThese lower-court decisions have for the most part not yet\\nbeen tested on appeal, and there is reason to think that\\nappeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more\\nsympathetic to the government\\'s tactics and arguments. \\n\\nThe federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., for instance,\\nreversed the decision to allow Mr. Hamdi to talk to a\\nlawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider\\nadditional evidence and arguments. \\n\\nBut even the appeals court seemed torn, and it rejected the\\ngovernment\\'s sweeping argument that the courts have no role\\nin reviewing the government\\'s designation of an American\\ncitizen as an enemy combatant. \\n\\nThe detention issues also carry an emotional punch. Many of\\nthe Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were\\ncabdrivers, construction workers or other types of\\nlaborers, and some spent up to seven months in jail before\\nbeing cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released. \\n\\nLast month, at a conference held by a federal appeals\\ncourt, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state in the\\nClinton administration, snapped at Viet Dinh, an assistant\\nattorney general under President Bush, saying that the\\nadministration\\'s refusal to identify the people it had\\ndetained reminded him of the \"disappeareds\" in Argentina. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the\\nmothers marching in the streets asking for the names of\\nthose being held by the government,\" Mr. Christopher said.\\n\"We must be very careful in this country about taking\\npeople into custody without revealing their names.\" \\n\\nMr. Dinh, who came to the United States as a refugee from\\nVietnam, recalled his family\\'s anguish when his father was\\ntaken away in 1975 for \"re-education.\" In contrast, he\\nsaid, those detained by the United States were not being\\nsecretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek\\nlawyers. \\n\\n\"These are not incognito detentions,\" he said. \"The only\\nthing we will not do is provide a road map for the\\ninvestigations.\" \\n\\nAccording to the Justice Department, 752 of the more than\\n1,200 people detained since Sept. 11 were held on\\nimmigration charges. Officials said recently that 81\\nremained in detention. Court papers indicate there were\\nabout two dozen material witnesses, while most of the other\\ndetainees were held on various state and federal criminal\\ncharges. \\n\\nPresident Bush also has announced plans to try suspected\\nforeign terrorists before military tribunals, though no\\nsuch charges have been brought yet. \\n\\nLast month, William G. Young, the federal judge presiding\\nin Boston over the criminal case against Richard C. Reid, a\\nBritish citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his\\nshoe on a trans-Atlantic flight, noted that the very\\nestablishment of those tribunals \"has the effect of\\ndiminishing the American jury, once the central feature of\\nAmerican justice.\" \\n\\nJudge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan,\\nadded: \"This is the most profound shift in our legal\\ninstitutions in my lifetime and - most remarkable of all -\\nit has taken place without engaging any broad public\\ninterest whatsoever.\" \\n\\nJack Goldsmith and Cass R. Sunstein, professors at the\\nUniversity of Chicago Law School, have written that the\\nBush administration\\'s policies are a minimal challenge to\\ncivil liberties especially compared with changes during the\\ntimes of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. What\\nhas changed, they say, is a greater sensitivity to civil\\nliberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government. \\n\\nThe Secrecy \\n\\nU.S. Says Hearings \\nAre Not Trials \\n\\nTen days\\nafter last September\\'s attacks, Michael J. Creppy, the\\nnation\\'s chief immigration judge, quietly issued sweeping\\ninstructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out\\nto be more than 600 \"special interest\" immigration cases. \\n\\n\"Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all\\nother cases on the docket,\" Judge Creppy wrote. \"The\\ncourtroom must be closed for these cases - no visitors, no\\nfamily, and no press.\" \\n\\n\"This restriction,\" he continued, \"includes confirming or\\ndenying whether such a case is on the docket.\" \\n\\nThe government has never formally explained how it decided\\nwhich visa violators would be singled out for this\\nextraordinary process, and it has insisted that the\\ndesignations could not be reviewed by the courts. \\n\\nBut as it turns out, most of these cases involved Arab and\\nMuslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways, for\\nexample at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious\\nneighbors. Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that\\nonly a few of these detainees had any significant\\ninformation about possible terrorists. \\n\\nAs the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests, a series of\\nlegal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking\\nlegal setbacks for the administration. Several courts have\\nordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable\\nskepticism about the government\\'s justifications for its\\ndetention policies generally. \\n\\nLee Gelernt, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties\\nUnion, said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the\\nhardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on\\nviolations that in the past would not have resulted in\\nincarceration. \\n\\n\"Preventive detention,\" he said, \"is such a radical\\ndeparture from constitutional traditions that we certainly\\nshouldn\\'t be undertaking it solely on the Justice\\nDepartment\\'s say-so.\" \\n\\nMalek Zeidan\\'s detention would have been unexceptional had\\nit not given rise to one of the legal challenges that\\nthreatens to end the secret proceedings. \\n\\nMr. Zeidan, 42, is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa\\n14 years ago and has lived in Paterson, N.J., for more than\\na decade. Over the years, he has delivered pizzas, driven\\nan ice cream truck and pumped gas. When the Immigration and\\nNaturalization Service came around last Jan. 31 to ask him\\nabout a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud, Mr.\\nZeidan was working at Dunkin\\' Donuts, and his expired visa\\nsoon cost him 40 days in custody. \\n\\nWhen a hearing was finally held three weeks after his\\ndetention, the judge closed the courtroom, excluding Mr.\\nZeidan\\'s cousin and reporters. \\n\\nThe closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal\\ncourt, from both Mr. Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers.\\nIn March, the government dropped the \"special interest\"\\ndesignation, Mr. Zeiden was released after posting a bond,\\nand the case he filed was dismissed. The immigration\\ncharges against him will be considered in the fall. \\n\\n\"You\\'re one of the lucky ones,\" his lawyer, Regis\\nFernandez, recalls telling Mr. Zeidan, given that other\\nvisa violators were held as long as six or seven months\\nbefore being deported or released. \\n\\nMr. Zeidan\\'s lawyers believe that their legal strategy,\\nwhich focused on openness, forced the government\\'s hand. \\n\\n\"The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt,\" Mr.\\nFernandez said. \"We figured if the public had access to\\nthese hearings they would see that nothing went on except\\nmultiple adjournments and delay.\" \\n\\nThrough a spokeswoman, Judge Creppy declined to comment. An\\nI.N.S. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be\\nnamed, said the agency had acted properly in Mr. Zeidan\\'s\\ncase and in similar cases. \\n\\nHe said the immigration service had always detained people\\nwithout bond who were linked to criminal investigations. He\\nadded that the agency had no choice now but to detain a\\nvisa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was\\nsure the person was not involved in terrorism. \\n\\n\"Consider the flip side - that you held him for two days\\nand then deported him, and 30 days later you found out he\\nwas a terrorist,\" the official said. \\n\\nThe newspapers\\' lawsuit has continued. It has already once\\nreached the Supreme Court, and the government\\'s papers\\ncontain one of the fullest accounts of its position on\\nsecrecy and executive power. \\n\\nIts main argument is that the courts have no role because\\nimmigration hearings are not really trials, but are merely\\nadministrative hearings that can be closed at will. \\n\\nBennet Zurofsky, who also represented Mr. Zeidan, said he\\nwas flabbergasted by this suggestion. \\n\\n\"A trial is a trial,\" he said. \"A person\\'s liberty is at\\nstake. A person is being held in jail. A person is being\\ntold where to live.\" \\n\\nBut in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases,\\nDale L. Watson, the executive assistant director for\\ncounterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F.B.I.,\\noutlined the reasoning behind the government demand for\\ntotal secrecy. \\n\\n\"Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous\\nin isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist\\ngroups,\" he said. \\n\\nThis rationale for withholding information, sometimes\\ncalled the mosaic theory, is controversial. \\n\\n\"It\\'s impossible to refute,\" Professor Kirtley said,\\n\"because who can say with certainty that it\\'s not true?\" \\n\\nIn May, John W. Bissell, the chief judge of the federal\\ndistrict court in Newark, appointed by President Reagan,\\nruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation\\nhearings nationwide to be opened, unless the government is\\nable to show a need for a closed hearing on a case-by-case\\nbasis. His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the\\nmonth before, though that case involved only a single\\ndetainee. \\n\\nThe government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the\\nThird Circuit, in Philadelphia, and asked it to block Judge\\nBissell\\'s order until the appeal was decided. The court,\\nwhich will hear arguments in September, declined to do\\nthat. A number of news organizations, including The New\\nYork Times, filed a brief as a friend of the court in\\nsupport of the newspapers. \\n\\nThe government then asked the United States Supreme Court\\nto stay Judge Bissell\\'s order. The court, in a relatively\\nunusual move given that the case was not before it for any\\nother purpose, blocked Judge Bissell\\'s order, suggesting\\nthat it might have more sympathy for the government\\'s\\narguments. \\n\\nThe Witnesses \\n\\nRights Violated, \\nLawyers Contend \\n\\nLate on Sept. 12, federal agents pulled\\ntwo nervous Indian men, Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul\\nMohammed Shah, off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth. They\\nwere carrying box cutters, black hair dye and about $5,000\\nin cash and had also shaved their body hair. \\n\\nThe agents\\' suspicions were obvious. The hijackers had used\\nbox cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and\\nhad received letters instructing them to \"shave excess hair\\nfrom the body.\" An F.B.I. affidavit dated Sept. 15 said\\nthere was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian\\nmen were involved in, or \"were associated\" with, those\\nresponsible for the Sept. 11 attacks. \\n\\nBut even though government officials told reporters that\\nthe men had been detained as material witnesses, their\\nlawyers now say that they were held last fall only on\\nimmigration violations. \\n\\nThe distinction is important because a material witness\\nwarrant brings the automatic appointment of a\\ngovernment-paid lawyer, while the government does not have\\nto supply a visa violator with counsel. \\n\\nAs a result, the authorities were able to question each of\\nthe men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer\\npresent, their current lawyers say. \\n\\nLike some of the people who were picked up as material\\nwitnesses, the Indian men were held in isolation in jails\\nin New York for extended periods. It was 91 days before Mr.\\nAzmath received a lawyer and 57 days before Mr. Shah did,\\ntheir lawyers say. \\n\\n\"It\\'s wrong to keep a man in jail for 57 days and never\\nbring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights,\"\\nMr. Shah\\'s lawyer, Lawrence K. Feitell, said in an\\ninterview. \"It\\'s wrong not to provide him with an attorney\\nat the threshold. It\\'s wrong to depict this as an I.N.S.\\ninvestigation, when in truth and in fact, it\\'s the main\\ninquiry into the World Trade Center debacle.\" \\n\\nAnthony L. Ricco, the lawyer for Mr. Azmath, said his\\nclient was interrogated \"often times for several hours a\\nday, with multiple interviewers, getting rapid-fire\\nquestions from three or four different people.\" \\n\\nEventually, the F.B.I. and the prosecutors cleared the men\\nof any involvement in terrorism, and both pleaded guilty in\\nJune in a credit-card fraud scheme and are awaiting\\nsentencing. \\n\\nFederal prosecutors said in court papers that both men\\nconsented to questioning. Each \"was read and waived his\\nMiranda rights before each interview,\" prosecutors wrote,\\nadding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses.\\n\\n\\nThe United States attorney in Manhattan, James B. Comey,\\nwould not comment on the specific cases, but said generally\\nof the government\\'s tactics: \"I don\\'t see any violation of\\nany rule, regulation, or law. \\n\\n\"I can understand defense lawyers not being happy,\" he\\nsaid. \"But I know our position after 9/11 was to use every\\navailable tool, to stay within the rules but play the whole\\nfield and recognize the boundaries, but cover the whole\\nfield. \\n\\n\"We need to do whatever we can that\\'s legal to investigate\\nand disrupt,\" he added. \\n\\nToday, it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen\\nmaterial witnesses, perhaps as few as two, are still being\\ndetained. \\n\\nBut the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred\\nintense criticism. \\n\\nLast April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District\\nCourt in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law \"to detain\\npeople who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in\\norder to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of\\nthe statute.\" \\n\\nJudge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when\\nwitnesses were held to give testimony at trials, not for\\ngrand jury investigations. \"Since 1789,\" Judge Scheindlin\\nsaid, \"no Congress has granted the government the authority\\nto imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that\\nhe will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal\\ninvestigation.\" \\n\\nThen last month, Chief Judge Michael B. Mukasey, also of\\nFederal District Court in Manhattan, upheld the\\ngovernment\\'s use of the material witness statute in grand\\njury investigations, criticizing Judge Scheindlin\\'s\\nreasoning. \\n\\nJudge Mukasey, citing the assertion in 1807 by Chief\\nJustice John Marshall that \"the public has a right to every\\nman\\'s evidence,\" held that detentions of material witnesses\\nduring investigations are proper. \\n\\nThe War Captives \\n\\nNo Lawyers Allowed \\nUnder U.S. Label \\n\\nYasser Esam Hamdi, a\\nSaudi national who was captured in Afghanistan, is probably\\nan American citizen by virtue of having been born in\\nLouisiana. His case represents the core issue of what kind\\nof role the nation\\'s courts should have, if any, in\\nreviewing the government\\'s imprisonment of someone charged\\nwith something akin to a war crime. \\n\\nProsecutors will be back in Federal District Court in\\nNorfolk, Va., next Thursday to confront one of the federal\\njudges who has shown resistance to the government\\'s\\napproach that once someone is declared an \"enemy combatant\"\\nby the president, all judicial review ceases. \\n\\nJudge Robert G. Doumar, an appointee of President Reagan,\\nhas twice ruled that Mr. Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and\\nordered the government to allow Frank Dunham, the federal\\npublic defender, to be allowed to visit him without\\ngovernment officials or listening devices. Judge Doumar\\nsaid that \"fair play and fundamental justice\" require it.\\nHe said the government \"could not cite one case where a\\nprisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United\\nStates District Court, who was held incommunicado and\\nindefinitely.\" \\n\\nBut the three-judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge\\nDoumar\\'s order, saying he had not fully considered the\\ngovernment\\'s needs to keep Mr. Hamdi incommunicado and,\\nmore important, the executive branch\\'s primacy in areas of\\nforeign and military affairs. \\n\\n\"The authority to capture those who take up arms against\\nAmerica belongs to the commander in chief,\" Chief Judge J.\\nHarvie Wilkinson 3rd wrote for the appeals panel. \\n\\nBut even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at\\nthe breadth of what the government was asserting when he\\nasked the Justice Department\\'s lawyer, \"You are saying that\\nthe judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone\\'s\\nstature as an enemy combatant?\" \\n\\nThe government has relented slightly, agreeing to provide\\nthe court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by\\nwhich they have judged Mr. Hamdi to be an enemy combatant.\\nBut the government has argued that judges cannot argue with\\nthe standards. \\n\\nJudge Doumar has indicated that he will question the\\ngovernment closely on those standards. \\n\\nThe case of Jose Padilla, which has not progressed as far\\nas that of Mr. Hamdi, may present an even greater challenge\\nto normal judicial procedures. \\n\\nMr. Padilla, also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, is, like\\nMr. Hamdi, an American citizen, imprisoned in a naval brig\\nafter having been declared an enemy combatant. But unlike\\nMr. Hamdi, Mr. Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield\\nby the military but on United States soil by civil law\\nenforcement authorities, on May 8 in Chicago. \\n\\nAfter his detention as a material witness based on\\nsuspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and\\ninformation to build a radioactive bomb, he was transferred\\nto military custody. \\n\\n\"This is the model we all fear or should fear,\" said Mr.\\nDunham, the public defender. \"The executive branch can\\narrest an American citizen here and then declare him an\\nenemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the\\ncourts. They can keep him indefinitely without charging him\\nor giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any\\nevidence.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/national/04CIVI.html?ex=1029550865&ei=1&en=c82350bcf915e44e\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's\\nbecause I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues\\nwith 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy\\nperl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,\\nat least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.

It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to\\nother unixen like HPUX and SCO.\\n\\n Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One\\nof the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your\\nhardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,\\nthey have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software\\nproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.\\n\\n If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There\\nis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,\\nthough some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.\\n\\n You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,\\nwho do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,\\nthat has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a\\ncheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.\\n\\nJohn\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  u'URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000647\\nDate: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00\\n\\n=== Scissors === \\n\\nI, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike \\neveryone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for \\npermission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a \\nbox of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket \\nwas suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. \\n\\n    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my \\n    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. \\n\\nShe put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They \\ntook everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used \\nthe opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked \\nback up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying \"This can\\'t \\ngo on board.\" \"I don\\'t remember packing that,\" I said. I let her confiscate it. \\n\\nI called my Mom. She doesn\\'t remember packing it either. Is there some sort of \\nterrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people\\'s suitcases? I \\ncan\\'t see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I\\'m on? Once \\nI\\'m on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but \\nif they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the \\nscissors? Perhaps it\\'s some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their \\nfists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky \\nmouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, \\nthey use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they \\nuse the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever \\nterrorists. \\n\\n*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was \\nusing to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The \\nnation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  \\n\\n=== Waiting for Wireless === \\n\\nNow I am at O\\'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral\\'s Club while \\nbusinessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I \\nused last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, \\nI had an Admiral\\'s Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite \\nthe airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, \\nyou know)--I doubt they will accept it. \\n\\n=== Irony === \\n\\nAccording to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his \\nflight. \\n\\nI think of what I\\'d say if I ran into him. \"Jack!\" I\\'d exclaim, as if we were \\nold pals. \"Going to the Eldred case?\" Of course he was. \"Going to be a good \\none.\" \"Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?\" I\\'d ask. \"You said \\nyou were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the \\nInternet. What ever happened to that?\" I imagine him mumbling and looking down \\nat his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. \\n\\nAnother announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing \\nthese airline announcements keep me up to date. \\n\\n=== Automatic Flush Toilets === \\n\\nNow I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In \\nthe first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little \\nshort...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle \\none mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three \\ntimes. \\n\\nThis is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they \\nexpect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied \\nimmediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer\\'s web \\nsite. \\n\\n=== Arrival === \\n\\nI\\'ve arrived in D.C.--once again, I\\'m sitting a block away from my hotel on the \\nsidewalk borrowing someone\\'s connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with \\nLisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now \\nfor the meetings and parties. \\n\\nSorry for not responding to your email. I\\'m rather busy. ;-)\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  u\"> I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry\\n> standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,\\n> and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow\\n> link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad\\n> compared with modern mailers.\\n\\nThese are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here.  (Is that permitted? :)\\n\\nI started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.\\n\\nWhat I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.\\n\\nI haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.\\n\\n-=d\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-users mailing list\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  u'Anyone who doesn\\'t appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at\\npart of the equation.\\n\\nAmerica has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is\\na huge one -- you don\\'t necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There\\nis an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the\\nright time, to go that high.\\n\\nBeyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is\\ninvolved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.\\nThough I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.\\nCindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.\\n\\nMost people, of course, aren\\'t in those stratified realms.  It is the\\nrest of us who tend to sort.\\n\\nThere is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the\\nfirst place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn\\'t exist.  Sowell seems to agree\\nat least in part, but I\\'m sure Sowell would also state that the benefits\\nof pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.\\n\\nAnd if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity\\nof heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most\\npeople seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better\\nif it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the\\nForbes list, or even just being a garden variety \\'millionaire next door\\'\\nis more likely to be the \\'serving customers\\' definition.\\n\\nDifferences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far\\nmore animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.\\nSuperior performance, often not.\\n\\n\\n> -----Original Message-----\\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\\nGeege\\n> Schuman\\n> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 4:44 PM\\n> To: R.

       "  u'I\\'ve never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here\\'s the \\nbehaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I \\nalso have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh \\nwindow and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select \\nit and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the \\nrecently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and \\nleave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no \\nlonger highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this \\nbehaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what \\nI paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more \\nspecific, here\\'s what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:\\n\\nApplication       What gets pasted\\n\\nXEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh\\nxterm             same as XEmacs\\nAbiWord           nothing\\nNedit             nothing\\nsedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten\\n\\nThe last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then \\nobviously that\\'s what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets \\npasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted \\nand typed over (I have \"Type Kills SEL\" on.).\\n\\nIt seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to \\npaste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??\\n\\n--\\nrick\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-users mailing list\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Secondly, both groups were located in Australia and whilst one  \\r\\nwas talking about importing an iPad from the US, the other was asking  \\r\\nif they could use it in the UK when they visited family there later in  \\r\\nthe year.\\r\\nSteve Jobs made it abundantly clear in his Keynote speech launching  \\r\\nthe iPad that it was NOT locked to any carrier... yet on both MUG  \\r\\nlists, people responded saying the iPad was likely to be locked in to  \\r\\nAT&T and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the iPad as  \\r\\nthey had hoped... which was just plain wrong!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I not saying that User Groups always get it wrong... more often  \\r\\nthen not they don\\'t and they do actually provide an independent  \\r\\nviewpoint... for example, the discussion on this very list about how  \\r\\nbest to demo an iPad was very enlightening and provided far more  \\r\\ninformation on the topic then I got out of my contacts at Apple  \\r\\nAustralian (and Apple US) on how do do the same thing when the iPhone  \\r\\nfirst came out here (about 18 months AFTER the US go it - so it wasn\\'t  \\r\\nexactly the latest news then and I\\'m sure others had similar queries  \\r\\nat  the time).\\r\\n\\r\\n> The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media  \\r\\n> presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it is up to User Groups to address that themselves.... which  \\r\\nagain harks back to the original topic of this thread\\r\\n\\r\\nHere in Australia, we have taken steps towards addressing this... I  \\r\\nproduced a full page flyer promoting active Apple User Groups here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee Page 15 of the Feb/Mar issue of the AppleUsers Spotlight (a 30+  \\r\\npage digital format magazine I publish here in Australia) for an  \\r\\nexample of the ad.\\r\\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/magazine/february-2010-issue-of-appleusers-spotlight-now-available/\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\'electronic\\' copy of the flyer has each user group name as an  \\r\\nactive hyperlink, so people can jump straight to a group in their state.\\r\\nIf it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer, then there is still the  \\r\\nsimple URL that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with  \\r\\nlinks to the various groups own webpages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\'primary\\' URL used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and  \\r\\neveryone agreed that we wouldn\\'t use the www.apple.com/au/usergroup  \\r\\nlink (or even the www.apple.com.au/usergroup one) as quite a few of  \\r\\nthe \\'active\\' groups here have chosen NOT to be listed there - so they  \\r\\ncan be seen as been independent from Apple (and any other retailer)  \\r\\nand also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI just realised that the ad needs updating - we don\\'t mention the iPad  \\r\\nin the current version :)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a portrait version on hand if we need it... in fact, the  \\r\\nflyer started out as an A4 size portrait flyer when we were approached  \\r\\nto have an ad in one of Australian Macworld\\'s Super Guide publications  \\r\\n- unfortunately we couldn\\'t arrange enough funding to go ahead with  \\r\\nthe idea in the time frame at hand... but now we have a solid basis to  \\r\\nwork from the next time an opportunity presents itself\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing stopping a group of User Groups in a \\'state\\',  \\r\\n\\'region\\' or \\'area\\' from getting together and producing their own  \\r\\nversion of such an ad.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also love what Mac Users UK have done with their Google map showing  \\r\\nthe location of each User Group in the UK (and Ireland)\\r\\nhttp://www.macusersuk.org/mugs/mugsmap.php  I really must work out how  \\r\\nto create such a Map for Australian User Groups :)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Let me make an analogy...  At music fairs like Lollapalooza and  \\r\\n> Lilith Fair,\\r\\n> there are secondary stages where lots of great musicians and groups  \\r\\n> get\\r\\n> major exposure.  They\\'re not getting the limelight, but they sure  \\r\\n> get in\\r\\n> front of lots of people they wouldn\\'t otherwise.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> Not only do we not get secondary stage placement, but we can\\'t even  \\r\\n> hang out\\r\\n> at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out  \\r\\n> flyers\\r\\n> about our groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, most \\'concerts\\' and major events organisers discourage  \\r\\n\\'hawkers\\' from \\'hassling\\' people at the gates/entrance... but they\\'ll  \\r\\nquite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession  \\r\\nstand near by (and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as  \\r\\nwell)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd why should Apple be expected do the marketing for independent User  \\r\\nGroups???\\r\\nYes, I know User Groups \\'promote\\' Apple products... but we have chosen  \\r\\nto do so... we aren\\'t compelled to do so.\\r\\nWe come together in User Groups (or even in online communities such as  \\r\\nthis) to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a  \\r\\ncommon topic of interest to us... just like there are groups that get  \\r\\ntogether as book clubs, or reptile keepers, even \"gunzels\" get  \\r\\ntogether through their common interest in trains (real ones and model  \\r\\nones).  No one makes them form these groups nor force people to  \\r\\nparticipate... and most other \\'hobbies\\' aren\\'t so (un)fortunate to  \\r\\nhave a \\'central\\' business or entity to focus around, yet they survive  \\r\\nand even flourish all by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Chris\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--\\r\\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\\r\\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n _______________________________________________\\r\\nDo not post admin requests to the list.

       "  u'================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============\\n\\nEvery once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it\\'s going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it\\'s hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I\\'m writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. \\n\\n\\nThe truth is, you\\'ve got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you\\'ve been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don\\'t need to hear, I\\'m just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with \\'Send Link\\' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn\\'t a trick, I\\'m just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don\\'t want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you\\'re one of those cautious people (and who isn\\'t these days on the Internet), that likes to \"look before you leap\" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we\\'re all smiling!!\\n\\n\\nPlease do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000.

       "  u\"Hello all,\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm trying to create an empty QTMovie object that I can add segments to, \\r\\nand then play. This is easy to do with something like:\\r\\n\\r\\nmovie = [[QTMovie alloc] initToWritableData:[NSMutableData \\r\\ndataWithCapacity:1048576] error:&error];\\r\\n\\r\\nI can then use -insertSegmentOfMovie to insert segments from other \\r\\nmovies into this one so I can play it back. The problem is that I also \\r\\nneed to set a certain attribute when creating the QTMovie object. In \\r\\nparticular, I need to set the QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute \\r\\nattribute, so that I can alter playback speed during playback without \\r\\nchanging pitch. This attribute cannot be written after the movie is \\r\\ninitialized.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I can create the QTMovie object like this:\\r\\n\\r\\nmovie = [[QTMovie alloc] initWithAttributes:[NSDictionary \\r\\ndictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], \\r\\nQTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute, nil] error:&error];\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, this is not editable. I've tried setting the \\r\\nQTMovieEditableAttribute as well on creation, but it does not help. I \\r\\nstill get an exception when I try to insert anything into this movie.
